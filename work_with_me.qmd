### Personality Test Insights

Understanding my personality helps me navigate both personal and professional relationships effectively. Here, I present the results of two personality tests taken in 2018 and 2023, highlighting the similarities and differences over the years.

#### 2023 Results: The Orchestrator

In 2023, my personality was most aligned with "The Orchestrator" archetype. Orchestrators excel at bringing people together, organizing around them, and mobilizing resources to achieve and exceed expectations. They are planful, precise, engaging, and people-oriented. Key attributes include:

- **Organizing People and Resources**: Skilled in connecting people and understanding their unique strengths.

Additionally, I possess attributes of a Strategist and a Shaper, which include generating effective strategies, being driven, and adaptable.

#### 2018 Results: Inspiring Helper (Accommodating)

In 2018, my personality was described as an "Inspiring Helper (Accommodating)." Key attributes included:

- **Friendly and Sociable**: Enjoying social interactions and being a good team player.

*Placeholder for anecdotes illustrating how these personality traits have manifested in real-life situations.*

### Work Style and Preferences

**Preferred Work Environment**

I thrive in environments where I can observe others working and interacting. This inspiration from others' productivity helps me overcome procrastination and fuels a positive feedback loop that enhances my concentration and confidence. While I work remotely, I find coworking spaces most effective as they provide the social environment I need without necessarily involving direct collaboration. I enjoy in-person interactions and seek to create strong bonds with team members, recognizing the value of face-to-face connections.

I appreciate both structured and unstructured environments, depending on the context. I prefer imposing structure on myself, maintaining a fully planned calendar, and being the master of my hours. However, I find unstructured environments challenging when they demand skills I am still developing. My growth and learning-driven nature propels me to close these skill gaps actively.

**Work Habits**

My day starts at 6:00 AM with a structured morning routine:
- Light morning stretches (10 min)
- Coffee (5 min)
- Body scan + gratitude meditation (10 min)
- Reading (40-60 min)
- Mini-essay writing (20-60 min)
- Planning three key tasks for the day (5 min)
- Sports (run, swim, or cycle) (60 min)
- Arriving at the coworking space (15 min)

I begin my workday at 9:00 AM with a daily standup call and avoid using my phone until after my writing session. To prioritize tasks, I use custom made "Kay's Operating System" on Notion, tracking weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals, relationships, and daily tasks through a Kanban board. I favor one-week sprints with Monday planning and Friday retrospective meetings, and I strictly cap my workday at 6:00 PM, followed by a brief "end of workday"reflection.

**Collaboration and Teamwork**

I often take on leadership and initiating roles within teams, organizing efforts around a shared cause. To handle conflicts, I employ the "disagree but commit" strategy, which helps in making progress despite disagreements. I am interested in developing a "pre-outcome bets" approach to improve conflict resolution by predicting outcomes before decisions are made.

**Communication Style**

I prefer daily face-to-face communication via short calls, complemented by asynchronous communication through Slack. My communication style is direct, informed by my German background, but I strive to use the nonviolent communication framework (NVC) for feedback and challenging situations. I meticulously prepare for important conversations, ensuring they are solution-oriented with actionable steps. I value conversations with clear agendas, which I prepare when hosting meetings for efficiency.

**Motivation and Productivity**

Uninterrupted deep work time is crucial for my productivity. I thrive on intrinsic motivation, working best when I have no external expectations and am driven by personal goals. Financial security and freedom are important to me, and I aim to build a financial cushion following the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) philosophy. I rely on colleagues and friends to stay motivated during long projects, with bi-weekly coaching sessions and daily standups as key motivators. Recently, I have experimented with "building in public" for additional motivation.

**Flexibility and Adaptability**

I prefer focusing on one task at a time and completing it promptly. While I handle multiple projects simultaneously, I avoid multitasking as it hampers productivity. I actively combat the urge to multitask to ensure I remain effective and avoid the negative experiences associated with it.

**Building and Maintaining Relationships**

Networking and relationship building are vital, though I sometimes neglect them when diving into technical projects. To counter this, I use a customer relationship management system (CRM) and a friend relationship management system (FRM). I interact with around 40 people weekly, with roughly 30% of those interactions being long or otherwise meaningful. Regular meetings with key individuals in my life, on weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly cadences, are critical for maintaining these relationships.

**Balancing Work and Personal Life**

I maintain a sharp cutoff for work at 6:00 PM to ensure I have energy for personal activities, which helps me start the next day refreshed and productive. My morning routine includes time for myself and my partner, and I spend evenings with friends, my partner, or alone to stay sane and functional. Stress management strategies include talking to a coach, taking regular breaks, engaging in sports, eating healthily, and organizing fun events for friends.
