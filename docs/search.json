    "text": "Smelly Vagabounds(,) and Thinkers\n\nI highly recommended listening Epic Mountain while reading this piece.\n\nIt all started last year when I began reading “The master algorithm” by Pedro Domingos. The smell of sweaty hungover travelers was thickening the air in the Columbian 10-bed dorm I found shelter in. Although I would later find out how little I actually understood, a profound feeling of understanding the complex world we have to navigate, creeped up my sleeve as I kept on reading about artificial intelligence, algorithms, and philosophy. Wait a moment - philosophy? Yeah, philosophy. Many brilliant thoughts that Domingos writes about started out their journey in the head of a thinker’s curiosity-driven pursuit of knowledge - ergo philosophy. As you might guess the epiphanic feeling of understanding “what the heck was going on in the world of tech” didn’t last long. Soon enough I was not only surrounded by smelly vagabonds but also by heavily complex thoughts ranging from philosophy to computer science and back to the world of mathematics. A little lost and confused I decided to put down the book and get to grips with the basics first. That’s when I decided to devote the majority of my time reading and studying philosophy. The next image is a depiction of me. Literally, go ask my friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward, December 2019. Over the last couple of months, I devoted a good chunk of my time pondering philosophical questions, when I got curious again. Now that I had at least a basic understanding of philosophy, I remembered that there was something else that bugged my mind. Algorithms, Programming and Mathematics. I should start getting technical right? - Yep. And so I did. Well, at least I tried. Getting into programming and refreshing some of my mathematical knowledge wasn’t as easy as previously thought.\nWeeks later, near the end of February 2020, I finally managed to pull through the strenuous task of finishing my first online Machine Learning Course. Did I enjoy it? Well… It was tough, and I was nowhere near to programming my first line in Python, which by now I knew was the go-to programming language for Machine Learning. But then again, did I even try learning to write any Python code? Mhm, let’s skip that part. Being the problem solver that I am I tried to find a better, more satisfying way to get into AI. I was determined to learn. Hell, so determined that I walked around my new hometown Madrid for 3 weeks on end to talk to people who’d already been navigating the complex world of machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. After several failed attempts to find a suitable environment to learn, I got lucky. The Immune Coding Institute offered a Data Science Bootcamp, and I was accepted to partake! I jumped on that chance and grabbed it by the balls.\n“Finally, every day I’ll be surrounded by like-minded people with whom I’ll share a common goal: Becoming a Data Scientist.” - At least that’s what I thought. Invigorated, enthusiastic and full of joy I completed the first two sessions of the Bootcamp only to wake up the next day to realize that the Corona Crisis had reached Madrid. Another setback to my efforts of becoming a Data Scientist? No, not this time!\n\n\nRegnosis: The Corona Crisis, a blessing in disguise?\nLike many of you out there, I am trapped at home, prohibited from going out. It’s shit, right? Well, actually, no! Why’s that, you might ask. Here’s the thing, let’s make a thought experiment, good ol’ philosopher-style. In hindsight, what will you think of today’s situation 6 months from now? Go ahead, take a couple of minutes, maybe write down your thoughts, it’s a great way to stay sane!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what I think. 6 months from now many of us will look back at today and revisit the boredom that they experienced and how they went about changing their relationship to it:\n“Wow, I never thought that the Crisis was such a blessing. All the time it freed up for me. I was so stressed every day, running from one obligation to another, depriving myself of spending time with my friends and family. But then, when I was forced to stay home, it kind of clicked. First, I was bored and tended to binge on Netflix, but that got boring quite quickly too. The realization came late, but when I realized that this crisis was a reminder of all that’s important in life, I quickly gained control over the situation. I remember the day that I finally found time to do what I was longing to do for so long. I eventually started”XYZ” (writing/ playing music/ learning a new language) - fill in whatever dream of yours you wanted to pursue but lacked the time to do. Damn, if it wasn’t for the crisis I might still be wondering what it was like to do “XYZ”.\nPeople who realize this fast enough will be able to act upon the newly freed time and will profit tremendously in whatever area they choose to apply it to.\n\n\nCall to arms\nFor those of you who have not already changed the Browser Tab to start another binging marathon on Netflix, firstly, thanks. Secondly, here’s the deal! I want you to take 5 minutes and think of everything that you always wanted to do but never “found time for”. Then pick one thing and start acting on it.\nAs I know that it’s always easier said than done, I encourage you to follow my lead. I’ll have a weekly posting schedule where I’ll blog about my journey of becoming a Data Scientist. I want you to engage with me and comment on what you did in your personal project.\nOk, that’s basically it. If you’re done, feel free to write a comment down below or hit me up on LinkedIn to help each other stay motivated on our journey.\n\n\nGratefulness:\nBefore ending this post I would like to give a big thank you to the following people for inspiring me to take action and embark on a crazy journey to becoming a Data Scientist:\n\nAndrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke for being kick-ass instructors that know how to ignite their students’ passion for a subject as complex as machine learning. Check out their Course if you’re interested in Data Science\nImmune Coding Institute for believing in me and giving me a chance to study Data Science at their wonderful facilities\nPedro Domingos who wrote the challenging book without whom I wouldn’t have had the curiosity to dive deeper and gather the necessary knowledge to understand his brilliant work\nMy girlfriend for preparing world-class scrambled eggs to free up time for my projects\nMy family for supporting me mentally and financially on my crazy adventures\nEpic Mountain for making inspiring music that transforms your brain into a pondering - machine!"

    "text": "To be or not to be\n\nWhat I’ve learned from trying too hard.\n\nIn what follows I’ll explain how to start a new endeavor and stick with it. More concretely the notion of identity-based and goal-based achievement will be discussed in consideration of how to develop the necessary mindset that results in sustainable, repeatable and pleasurable habits which in turn will yield a fruitful ground for achievement.\nA few weeks back an excited youngster sat at his desk trying to make sense of a bad situation and assign it some meaning. He would go on to formulate his ideas in a rush of feel-good endorphins. The pounding of keys would finally end after a short distance writing-sprint. After adding a witty title here and some funny pictures there, his first written piece was ready to be published. That should do for a first blog post, right? Right. Click - post - share - ask for feedback - get lavish praise by friends - wait until next week - hope to be blessed with random sparks of creativity - write again - repeat - become a writer - mission accomplished! As if, haha! Now who am I talking about, you’re asking? - Drumroll - That someone was me. Now some of you might ask what’s your point here? Isn’t that exactly how it works? Well no, here’s why.\n\n\nGoal-Based - Efforts\nThe above-described situation perfectly demonstrates how goal-based efforts work. As I set out on my journey the only thing on my mind was the goal: “Write a blog”. Now, a goal in and of itself is not a bad thing, but neither is it good, a goal is just a goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal-Based and Identity-Based EffortsAs seen in the diagram above, goal-based efforts work from the outside in. The typical goal-setting process starts out by defining what it is that you want to achieve. Let’s say your goal is to lose weight. You begin to produce certain outcomes, like losing a pound here and there due to training and eating right. The actions you take might or might not lead to habits, that eventually become automated as you go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Finally, if you’re in luck, you’ll finally incorporate being sporty, as part of your life. This process might take weeks, months or even years in some cases, but let’s be honest, we’ve all tried and failed at something like this, which leads makes me think, that there has to be a better way. Back to the story.\nIn my last blog post I proudly claimed, that I would upload 1 post per week in order to capture my journey of becoming a Data Scientist and Writer. Well, did you see me write anything in 3 weeks? Exactly, neither did I. Why? Mostly, because the anticipated exhilarating bursts of creativity didn’t appear according to plan, which quickly let me question my ability to write. This is by no means a valid excuse, which is precisely why I’m all the more thankful for what followed!\nA little beaten down by reality, an old friend of mine, Tom, taught me a valuable lesson. He asked me the following: Are you a writer or do you want to become one? In essence: “to be or not to be?”\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who want to understand the profound contemplation behind this quote, and not just my misuse of it, check out this fun Youtube Video!\nTom went on to explain the problem with goal-based efforts. Setting goals, followed up by painstakingly following down that road, without ever stopping and asking “Why?”, is the equivalent of going on a hike without any shoes. In short, the journey will be very painful, unenjoyable and over, rather quickly. You’ll give up on your hike before it even began.\n\n\nIdentity-based efforts:\nAnother approach that works much better than goal-based efforts, is to work from the inside out and focus on your identity first, Tom said. A bit confused I asked: “what do you mean by that?” Patiently, he elaborated: Before starting out on a new journey, ask yourself these fundamentals:\n\nWhy do I want to do this? What’s the purpose of all this?\nDo I see myself doing this, 10 years from now?\nIs this something I enjoy or can come to enjoy?\nAm I willing to invest at least a couple of minutes, every day?\n\nIf the answer to most of those is “yes!”, or “I don’t know, but I’m sure as hell willing to find out”, congratulations! You’re now officially a “(fill in whatever it is that you want to be)”. You’re probably still a bloody amateur, but that’s alright.\nI pondered these questions in the back of my mind, as Tom continued teaching. “You have now started to grow. You’ve incorporated a certain topic as an integral part of your life! This is a great leap forward because now, you don’t have the pressure to reach a certain goal anymore. Shifting your perspective away from goals will allow you to view every step onwards as an opportunity to learn. You’ll be able to improve who you already are, rather than trying to become someone. This way you recognize your own imperfections and take the actions needed to even them out. Soon enough, this newfound identity you’re shaping will result in habits that positively reinforce your growth. Your efforts will materialize in outcomes and you’ll lose weight, write something or do whatever it is that you wanted to do in the first place. In summary, you’ll set yourself up for success. You might not achieve one or another thing in the short run, but you’ll never quit on your new endeavor because now it’s part of who you are!” Woah. Let that sink for a moment. It took me 2 weeks to internalize this!\n\n\nConclusion:\nSo, what’s the main takeaway and how does it all tie back to my efforts of writing blogs? What Tom taught me is to “be”, rather than “become”. The hardest part about setting out on a new journey is starting and setting yourself up for success. By accepting that you are already a writer, a runner etc. you’ll eliminate the pressure of becoming that someone. This, in turn, allows you to shift your perspective towards improving yourself. In short, don’t try hard, try smart. Remember, the following:\n\nGoal-based efforts can only get you so far\nIdentity-based efforts are a surefire way to succeed in the long run\nAsk “Why?” before you start\nBuild habits and results will follow\n\n\n\nGratefulness:\n\nThank you, Tom Munk, for opening my eyes to this fundamental truth about any effort whatsoever in life. I’m back on track and I don’t plan on derailing. I owe you a lot and I’m planning on repaying it fully!\nThank you, Andrei Neagoie, for teaching me about the truths about learning, habits and compound learning."
