    "text": "Word2Vec is one of the most well-known word embedding algorithms. Although it has been succeeded in efficacy by more recent transformer-based algorithms like BERT and GPT, Word2Vec remains a valuable algorithm to understand. It was the first algorithm to produce word embeddings that captured both syntactic and semantic relationships between words, famously demonstrated by the “king - man + woman = queen” analogy. This made a profound contribution to natural language processing and kicked off a swath of impressive developments. In this post, we will take a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of Word2Vec. But before we do that, let’s first review why word embeddings are crucial for NLP tasks."

    "text": "Continous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)\nIn both CBOW and Skip-Gram, we differentiate between center and context words. The context words around the center word are limited by a context window, which was exactly 4 in the paper. This means that there are 4 context words preceeding (history) and 4 (future) following the center word. The choice of this parameter was not explained in the paper and one might actually want to tune it.\nLet’s look at a specific example but instead of using 4, let’s use a context window of 2 words. Here, the center Word “ChatGPT” is surrounded by the context words “GPT-4”, “outperforms”, “in”, “general”.\n\n\n\nThe difference between CBOW and Skip-Gram is what we actually want to predict. While CBOW uses the context words to predict the center word, Skip-Gram does the opposite and predicts the context words from the center word.\n\n\n\nBy now, we have a good high-level overview of Word2Vec. It is time to move to the technical implementation of CBOW. We will first look at the trainable weight matrices and an illustrative forward and backward pass. Later, we will interpret the more math-heavy part, the loss function.\n\nIllustrated Forward and Backward Pass\nThere are 2 trainable weight matrices: the input and output matrix.\n\nN denotes the number of embedding dimensions,\nV the vocabulary size.\n\nN is usually 50-300 and V in the Google News Dataset, as mentioned before, 3M.\nThe input weight matrix is tasked with generating the input embedding for the task, while the output matrix will produce the predictions i.e. probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. This will make more sense in a bit. For now what is crucial to understand, is that each token has an embedding in the input word matrix. This will be its context embedding. Additionally each token has an embedding in the output word matrix which is its center embedding. In other words, each word has 2 embeddings. The tokens in the Vocabulary need to be mapped to indices, so we can look up their embeddings in the input or output matrices using indexing.\n\nFun Fact: Zyzzyva is an actual word and refers to a type of weevils. I asked Google: “What is the last item in English dictionaries.”\n\n\n\n\nLet’s put all we know together by illustrating the forward and backward pass! Below, we use the same example of center and context words.\n\nUsing the token-index mapping, we look up the indices of the center and context words.\nThe 4 context words are taken from the input matrix and stacked horizontally.\nTo get the average context, we take the row-wise average of the context word embeddings.\nUsing the output (center) matrix, we calculate the dot product between each word in the vocabulary and the averaged context embedding. This is a matrix-vector multiplication. In the resulting score vector each item refers to the similarity (dot product) between the average context and the words in the vocabulary.\nTo get a probability distribution over the vocabulary, we apply softmax normalization.\nThe y_true vector will be OHE where the single non-zero element is at the index of the center word.\nFinally, we apply Cross-Entropy loss and apply backprop to calculate the gradients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective Function Explained\nNow that we have a better understanding of the forward and backward pass of CBOW, let’s examine the math. Actually, the math of the “vanilla” Word2Vec is not too convoluted, we just need to dissect the objective function.\n\nQuick disclaimer: you won’t find these functions in the original paper. Here, I am making use of [2] and [3] but I make an effort at simplyfying the notation and provide a more detailed explanation.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the data likelihood i.e. to maximize the probability of a center word \\(w_{t-1}\\) conditioned on the context words in context window of c \\(w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}\\), a given parameter set of \\(\\theta\\) which is the context and center embedding matrices. \\(T\\) denotes the tokens of the dataset i.e. all the words in the dataset.\n\\[\n\\text{Likelihood} = L(\\theta) =  \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}; \\theta)\n\\]\nHow do we calculate \\(P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c})\\)? We are yet to inject the word embeddings into these functions because now they refer to words. In section “Illustrated Forward and Backward Pass”, we said that each word has a corresponding context (input) and center (output) word vector. Let’s denote the context word matrix as \\(K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times |V|}\\) where \\(k_{i}\\) refers to the i-th column of K meaning the context embedding of word at index i. The center word matrix is denoted by \\(U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V| \\times n}\\) where center word embeddings are stacked row-wise. Similarly, \\(u_{i}\\) refers to the i-th row of U indicating the center embedding of word at index i.\nLet’s now write up how to express \\(P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c})\\) using the contex and center word embeddings and then explain it in more detail. Below \\(u_{t}\\) refers to the context embedding of the context word at position t. \\(\\bar{k_{c}}\\) refers to the average context embedding of the context words. By taking the dot product between these two, we get a similarity metric (an unnormalized one) between the center word and the average context. The higher the dot-product the more similar the vectors are i.e. the vectors point to a similar direction.\n\n\n\nBy calculating the dot product between all center word embedding and the average context embedding in the vocabulary (the denominator) and applying softmax, we get a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary.\n\\[P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}) = \\frac{exp(u_{t}\\bar{k_{c}})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}exp(u_{w}\\bar{k_{c}})}\\]\nIn machine learning, it is easier to work with the dual problem of maximizing likelihood which is minimizing the negative log likelihood. Using this trick makes the optimization easier. If you want to know why, I recommend reading this thread. Take the log of the product term results in the summation of logs. By convention, we optimize for the average log-likelihood, hence taking \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nJ(\\theta) & = -\\frac{1}{T} \\log L(\\theta) \\\\\n& = -\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\log P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}; \\theta)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOkay, so now we got a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary which is the prediction of the model but how do we relate this to the ground truth? The cost function does not (yet) include the y_true term though we use it for the cross-entropy loss calculation in the forward pass chart! I just left out this part from the cost function definition to not to make the formula too difficult to understand. The correct loss function for a given sample (a center word and its context) J is:\n\\[J = -\\sum_{w=1}^{V} y_{w}log(\\hat{y}_{w})\\]\nwhere\n\\[\\hat{y} = \\frac{exp(u_{t}\\bar{k_{c}})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}exp(u_{w}\\bar{k_{c}})}\\]\nSince the target, y vector is OHE, J reduces to where the i index refers to the target element of the target vector e.g. the index of “ChatGPT” as in the example:\n\\[J = -y_{i}log(\\hat{y_{i}})\\]\nWe can extend the formula to contain all training samples of the dataset but this is pretty much all about the CBOW version of Word2Vec. Except for one last thing. In the next section, we will review the training algorithm and point out its computation complexity and 2 methods that reduce the computational complexity: Negative Sampling and Hierarchical Softmax."

    "section": "Skip-Gram",
    "text": "Skip-Gram\nSkip-Gram flips the role of the context and center words. Here, the center word is used as input to predict the context (output) words. The forward and backward pass are illustrated below in a similar fashion as for CBOW. Observe the differences between the two architectures. Here, the input matrix is the one containing the center word embeddings, the output contains the context ones. We use the center word representation as input to calcute scores for the context outputs. Just like in CBOW, we make a softmax prediction over the entire vocabulary but we contrast these predictions against the multiple target context words which is indicated by the grey box on the right. In this example, we predict the 4 context words from the center.\n\n\n\nFor ease of notation, only a single sample’s training objective will be detailed. Let’s first start with the likelihood function again. Here, we aim to maximize the probability of context words conditioned on the center word. If we denote context lenght with c, there are 2c context words of which probabilities we aim to maximize (c history and c future context words).\n\\[\\text{Likelihood}=L(\\theta) =\\prod_{j=1}^{2c}P(w_{j} \\mid w_t; \\theta)\\]\nIt is important to note that the formula implies that we make a strong conditional independence assumption. Given a center word, all output words are completely independent (hence you can simply multiply the probabilities). This is definitely not true. Just think of simple grammar. If you have a noun center word followed by a verb context, then the upcoming context is quite unlikely to be a verb again. To give you an example, if you have the word Chelsea (a famous football club and also a district in London) as the center followed be played context then the next context is less likely to be a verb like jump and more likely to be an adjective like marvelously. Seeing this example you may even give semantical arguments why the conditional independence does not hold like nouns more related to football e.g. game is more likely to come up than academics related nouns e.g. conference. Nonetheless, Skip-Gram manages to work well in practice, thus we may be okay with this. By the way, it is the very same assumption that the Naive Bayes Classifier model makes. This naive assumption lets us to break out probabilities so we don’t have to deal with figuring out the joint distributions.\n[NOTE] I think an elaboration of this point may be useful\nThe softmax is used again to get the probability distribution over the vocabulary. Below \\(k_{t}\\) refers to the center word embedding while \\(u_{c}\\) to the context word embedding. This is the opposite of what we have seen in CBOW.\n\\[P(w_{j} \\mid w_t) = \\frac{\\exp(u_{j}k_{t})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})}\\]\nIf you take the negative log-likelihood for a single context word, given a center:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nJ & = -\\log P(w_{j} \\mid w_t) \\\\\n& = -\\log\\frac{\\exp(u_{j}k_{t})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})} \\\\\n& = -\\left[\\log \\exp(u_{j}k_{t}) - \\log\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})\\right] \\\\\n& = -\\left[u_{j}k_{t} -  \\log\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})\\right]\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nExpanding it to all context words:\n\\[ J = -\\sum_{j=1}^{2m}\\left[{u_{j}}{k_t} -log\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})\\right]\\]\nBy now, we have grokked the two versions of the Word2Vec algorithms. One detail is still missing though. As it was pointed out, each word has context and one center embedding. How to make one of them? Just simply average them! Next, let’s review some practical limitations and their remedies."

    "section": "Expensive Softmax and Alternatives",
    "text": "Expensive Softmax and Alternatives\nNote that in the softmax normalization, we normalize over the entire vocabulary which is huge. Its comoutational complexity is linear, \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\). In the case of Google News dataset it is ca. 6M tokens! Even if you have optimized, vectorized implementation of the softmax calculation, it would take very long to calculate the softmax for each sample in the dataset. As mentioned before, the 2 other innovations of Word2Vec, Hierarchical Softmax and Negative Sampling aim at this computational issue. To limit the scope of this blog post, we will only elaborate on Negative Sampling. While Negative sampling is a more straightforward concept and computationally more efficient, the results of Hierarchical Softmax are not better.\nAt this point I want to point out a little confusion on my part. Though in the first [1] paper, the authors introduced both Skip-Gram and CBOW, in the second they only proceeded with Skip-Gram without any explanation. At least I could not find any. The results in the first paper did not suggest any superiority of Skip-Gram. If you understand this decision, please let me know! :) Anyway, I will proceed in the same way as the authors did and use Skip-Gram accordingly.\n\nNegative Sampling\nThe idea of negative sampling, which was actually introduced in the second Word2Vec paper [2], is simple: instead of contrasting a given center and context word embedding pair against the entire vocabulary, why don’t we just contrast it against noise? In other words, what we aim here is to assess the probability that the center and context words came from the data. The trick is that we ingest negative (or fake if you like) context words so that we expect the model to tell these apart. If I have the center OpenAI and chatGPT as context, I want to assign high probability to this pair but low to a random pair like OpenAI and dachshund or OpenAI and daisy. We use k such negative samples for each positive one. The authors recommend 2-5 negative samples for bigger while 5-20 in smaller datasets. The likelihood function is given as below. \\(w_{t}\\) denotes the center, \\(w_{j}\\) the context word. The tilde marks the negative context sample.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Likelihood} & = P(D=1| w_{j}, w_{t}) \\prod_{i=1}^{K}P(D = 0| \\tilde{w_{j_i}}, w_{t}) \\\\\n& =  P(D=1) \\prod_{i=1}^{K}(1 - P(D = 1 | \\tilde{w_{j_i}}, w_{t}))\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWord2Vec uses the sigmoid function to model probability and for similarity we again use the dot product. Recall that \\(k_{t}\\) refers to the center word embedding while \\(u_{j}\\) to the context word embedding \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Likelihood} & = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u_{j} k_{t})} \\prod_{i=1}^{K} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u_{j_i} k_{t})}\\right) \\\\\n& =  \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u_{j} k_{t})} \\prod_{i=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(u_{j_i} k_{t})}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAgain, taking the negative log likelihood (NLL) as traning objective:\n\\[J = - log  \\frac{1}{1 + exp(-u_{j} k_{t})} - \\sum_{i=1}^{K} log \\frac{1}{1 + exp(u_{j_i} k_{t})}\\]\nIt seems that we have a loss function so we are all set! Almost… We still need to figure out how to draw negative samples i.e. define \\(P(\\tilde{w_{j_i}})\\). One might think of using a uniform distribution but that does not take into account word frequencies that we may want to take into consideration. The authors recommend using a scaled version of the unigram distribution \\(U(w)\\) (model based on word frequencies). They found empirically that the unigram distribution raised to the power of 3/4 \\(U(w)^{3/4}\\) works best. To build some intuition why this may be a particularly useful setting, let’s look at the below table of example. We have a 3 words, one is very frequent (at), another less frequent (cinema) and an infrequent one (dachshund). If we raise their relative frequencies to 3/4, then relatively, the infrequent dachshund gets 3x more frequent, cinema 1.7 while at only 1.5. You can see that by using this scaled version of unigram distribution for negative sampling, we increase the probability of drawing less frequent words on the expense of more frequent ones. This intuitively makes sense because without this, we may be drawing too similar negative samples e.g. “the, it” which does not seem to be noise, against we want to contrast the word embeddings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nRelative frequency - \\(f(x)\\)\nRe-scaled relative frequency - \\(f(x)^{3/4}\\)\n\n\n\n\nat\n0.3\n0.45\n\n\ncinema\n0.1\n0.17\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\ndachshund\n0.01\n0.03"

    "section": "Subsampling of frequent words",
    "text": "Subsampling of frequent words\nAnother trick that Word2Vec applies to put less emphasis on frequent words is subsampling. The authors argue that words like “in”, “the”, and “a” occur hundreds of millions of times in a large corpus of text. The co-occurence of these words arguably does not provide any useful information with other words e.g. “Paris”. However, the co-occurrence of other words e.g. “Paris” and “France” has immense useful information. Thus, it seems plausible to subsample the frequent words which speeds up training by skipping a share of the frequent word samples. Below, \\(P(x)\\) denotes the probability of x being skippend, \\(f(x)\\) the frequency of the word, \\(t\\) is a chosen threshold recommended to be around \\(10^{-5}\\). It is obvious that infrequent words will have very high probability of being picked. Frequent words are more likely to be skipped but this may be offset by a higher choice of \\(t\\) hyperparameter.\n\\[ P(x) = 1 -  \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{f(x)}}\\]"

    "text": "Other notes\nThough this has been quite an in-depth Word2Vec explainer, there is still a lot more to explore within and beyond the scope of Word2vec. I am going to just share a few more things in an unstructured way. You may decide to explore any of these in more detail.\n\nHyperparameters\nThroughout the post, I tried to point out the recommended range of hyperparameters. [8] provides further comments and tips by the authors.\nRecommended HPs: - Embedding size: 50-300 - Context size: 5-10 - Algorithm: Skip-gram/ CBOW - #negative samples: 2-5 (if dataset big enough) if using Negative Sampling and not Hierarchical Softmax - Epochs: 1-3 - Subsampling threshold \\(t\\): ca. \\(10^{-5}\\)\nThe paper does not touch upon what optimizer to use but one might benefit from using an adaptive one like Adam. This might make sense because we may want to apply larger updates to less frequent words.\n\n\nDataset\nThe quality of the dataset is maybe more important than the specific HP settings we choose. The paper used the proprietary Google News dataset but there are now much bigger datasets! Just look at how GloVe [8] benefits from larger and better datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\nEvaluating word vectors is an interesting task. There are 2 ways to do this: 1) intrinsic and 2) extrinsic. In intrinsic evaluation, typically, we do some kind of arithmetic of word embeddings and contrast it to our expectations. There are word similarity and analogy datasets that have been curated by humans. The authors open-sourced their own datasets for intrinsic evaluation: link. It contains semantic and syntactic analogies like “Athens-Greece+Madrid=Spain” and “occasional-occasionally+amazing=amazingly” In extrinsic evaluation, we see how the word embeddings influence the performance of downstream applications where these are used as inputs. Note, that the latter is less sterile because we not only expect “good” word embeddings but also a good interaction between them and the downstream-specific application algorithm.\n\n\nBias\nSince Word2Vec is trained on large corpus of data, it will be exposed of all the biases that surround us. Just think about how more often it will see male references to politicians or engineers and much less for kingergarten teacher or nurse. This begs loads of ethical questions and for solutions. This is a very important topic and I might devote more time to explore it more in a follow-up post. For now, you can take a look at [10] for more details or the “Bias and overgeneralization” part of [11]."

    "text": "Smelly Vagabounds(,) and Thinkers\n\nI highly recommended listening Epic Mountain while reading this piece.\n\nIt all started last year when I began reading “The master algorithm” by Pedro Domingos. The smell of sweaty hungover travelers was thickening the air in the Columbian 10-bed dorm I found shelter in. Although I would later find out how little I actually understood, a profound feeling of understanding the complex world we have to navigate, creeped up my sleeve as I kept on reading about artificial intelligence, algorithms, and philosophy. Wait a moment - philosophy? Yeah, philosophy. Many brilliant thoughts that Domingos writes about started out their journey in the head of a thinker’s curiosity-driven pursuit of knowledge - ergo philosophy. As you might guess the epiphanic feeling of understanding “what the heck was going on in the world of tech” didn’t last long. Soon enough I was not only surrounded by smelly vagabonds but also by heavily complex thoughts ranging from philosophy to computer science and back to the world of mathematics. A little lost and confused I decided to put down the book and get to grips with the basics first. That’s when I decided to devote the majority of my time reading and studying philosophy. The next image is a depiction of me. Literally, go ask my friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward, December 2019. Over the last couple of months, I devoted a good chunk of my time pondering philosophical questions, when I got curious again. Now that I had at least a basic understanding of philosophy, I remembered that there was something else that bugged my mind. Algorithms, Programming and Mathematics. I should start getting technical right? - Yep. And so I did. Well, at least I tried. Getting into programming and refreshing some of my mathematical knowledge wasn’t as easy as previously thought.\nWeeks later, near the end of February 2020, I finally managed to pull through the strenuous task of finishing my first online Machine Learning Course. Did I enjoy it? Well… It was tough, and I was nowhere near to programming my first line in Python, which by now I knew was the go-to programming language for Machine Learning. But then again, did I even try learning to write any Python code? Mhm, let’s skip that part. Being the problem solver that I am I tried to find a better, more satisfying way to get into AI. I was determined to learn. Hell, so determined that I walked around my new hometown Madrid for 3 weeks on end to talk to people who’d already been navigating the complex world of machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. After several failed attempts to find a suitable environment to learn, I got lucky. The Immune Coding Institute offered a Data Science Bootcamp, and I was accepted to partake! I jumped on that chance and grabbed it by the balls.\n“Finally, every day I’ll be surrounded by like-minded people with whom I’ll share a common goal: Becoming a Data Scientist.” - At least that’s what I thought. Invigorated, enthusiastic and full of joy I completed the first two sessions of the Bootcamp only to wake up the next day to realize that the Corona Crisis had reached Madrid. Another setback to my efforts of becoming a Data Scientist? No, not this time!\n\n\nRegnosis: The Corona Crisis, a blessing in disguise?\nLike many of you out there, I am trapped at home, prohibited from going out. It’s shit, right? Well, actually, no! Why’s that, you might ask. Here’s the thing, let’s make a thought experiment, good ol’ philosopher-style. In hindsight, what will you think of today’s situation 6 months from now? Go ahead, take a couple of minutes, maybe write down your thoughts, it’s a great way to stay sane!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what I think. 6 months from now many of us will look back at today and revisit the boredom that they experienced and how they went about changing their relationship to it:\n“Wow, I never thought that the Crisis was such a blessing. All the time it freed up for me. I was so stressed every day, running from one obligation to another, depriving myself of spending time with my friends and family. But then, when I was forced to stay home, it kind of clicked. First, I was bored and tended to binge on Netflix, but that got boring quite quickly too. The realization came late, but when I realized that this crisis was a reminder of all that’s important in life, I quickly gained control over the situation. I remember the day that I finally found time to do what I was longing to do for so long. I eventually started”XYZ” (writing/ playing music/ learning a new language) - fill in whatever dream of yours you wanted to pursue but lacked the time to do. Damn, if it wasn’t for the crisis I might still be wondering what it was like to do “XYZ”.\nPeople who realize this fast enough will be able to act upon the newly freed time and will profit tremendously in whatever area they choose to apply it to.\n\n\nCall to arms\nFor those of you who have not already changed the Browser Tab to start another binging marathon on Netflix, firstly, thanks. Secondly, here’s the deal! I want you to take 5 minutes and think of everything that you always wanted to do but never “found time for”. Then pick one thing and start acting on it.\nAs I know that it’s always easier said than done, I encourage you to follow my lead. I’ll have a weekly posting schedule where I’ll blog about my journey of becoming a Data Scientist. I want you to engage with me and comment on what you did in your personal project.\nOk, that’s basically it. If you’re done, feel free to write a comment down below or hit me up on LinkedIn to help each other stay motivated on our journey.\n\n\nGratefulness:\nBefore ending this post I would like to give a big thank you to the following people for inspiring me to take action and embark on a crazy journey to becoming a Data Scientist:\n\nAndrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke for being kick-ass instructors that know how to ignite their students’ passion for a subject as complex as machine learning. Check out their Course if you’re interested in Data Science\nImmune Coding Institute for believing in me and giving me a chance to study Data Science at their wonderful facilities\nPedro Domingos who wrote the challenging book without whom I wouldn’t have had the curiosity to dive deeper and gather the necessary knowledge to understand his brilliant work\nMy girlfriend for preparing world-class scrambled eggs to free up time for my projects\nMy family for supporting me mentally and financially on my crazy adventures\nEpic Mountain for making inspiring music that transforms your brain into a pondering - machine!"

    "text": "To be or not to be\n\nWhat I’ve learned from trying too hard.\n\nIn what follows I’ll explain how to start a new endeavor and stick with it. More concretely the notion of identity-based and goal-based achievement will be discussed in consideration of how to develop the necessary mindset that results in sustainable, repeatable and pleasurable habits which in turn will yield a fruitful ground for achievement.\nA few weeks back an excited youngster sat at his desk trying to make sense of a bad situation and assign it some meaning. He would go on to formulate his ideas in a rush of feel-good endorphins. The pounding of keys would finally end after a short distance writing-sprint. After adding a witty title here and some funny pictures there, his first written piece was ready to be published. That should do for a first blog post, right? Right. Click - post - share - ask for feedback - get lavish praise by friends - wait until next week - hope to be blessed with random sparks of creativity - write again - repeat - become a writer - mission accomplished! As if, haha! Now who am I talking about, you’re asking? - Drumroll - That someone was me. Now some of you might ask what’s your point here? Isn’t that exactly how it works? Well no, here’s why.\n\n\nGoal-Based - Efforts\nThe above-described situation perfectly demonstrates how goal-based efforts work. As I set out on my journey the only thing on my mind was the goal: “Write a blog”. Now, a goal in and of itself is not a bad thing, but neither is it good, a goal is just a goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal-Based and Identity-Based EffortsAs seen in the diagram above, goal-based efforts work from the outside in. The typical goal-setting process starts out by defining what it is that you want to achieve. Let’s say your goal is to lose weight. You begin to produce certain outcomes, like losing a pound here and there due to training and eating right. The actions you take might or might not lead to habits, that eventually become automated as you go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Finally, if you’re in luck, you’ll finally incorporate being sporty, as part of your life. This process might take weeks, months or even years in some cases, but let’s be honest, we’ve all tried and failed at something like this, which leads makes me think, that there has to be a better way. Back to the story.\nIn my last blog post I proudly claimed, that I would upload 1 post per week in order to capture my journey of becoming a Data Scientist and Writer. Well, did you see me write anything in 3 weeks? Exactly, neither did I. Why? Mostly, because the anticipated exhilarating bursts of creativity didn’t appear according to plan, which quickly let me question my ability to write. This is by no means a valid excuse, which is precisely why I’m all the more thankful for what followed!\nA little beaten down by reality, an old friend of mine, Tom, taught me a valuable lesson. He asked me the following: Are you a writer or do you want to become one? In essence: “to be or not to be?”\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who want to understand the profound contemplation behind this quote, and not just my misuse of it, check out this fun Youtube Video!\nTom went on to explain the problem with goal-based efforts. Setting goals, followed up by painstakingly following down that road, without ever stopping and asking “Why?”, is the equivalent of going on a hike without any shoes. In short, the journey will be very painful, unenjoyable and over, rather quickly. You’ll give up on your hike before it even began.\n\n\nIdentity-based efforts:\nAnother approach that works much better than goal-based efforts, is to work from the inside out and focus on your identity first, Tom said. A bit confused I asked: “what do you mean by that?” Patiently, he elaborated: Before starting out on a new journey, ask yourself these fundamentals:\n\nWhy do I want to do this? What’s the purpose of all this?\nDo I see myself doing this, 10 years from now?\nIs this something I enjoy or can come to enjoy?\nAm I willing to invest at least a couple of minutes, every day?\n\nIf the answer to most of those is “yes!”, or “I don’t know, but I’m sure as hell willing to find out”, congratulations! You’re now officially a “(fill in whatever it is that you want to be)”. You’re probably still a bloody amateur, but that’s alright.\nI pondered these questions in the back of my mind, as Tom continued teaching. “You have now started to grow. You’ve incorporated a certain topic as an integral part of your life! This is a great leap forward because now, you don’t have the pressure to reach a certain goal anymore. Shifting your perspective away from goals will allow you to view every step onwards as an opportunity to learn. You’ll be able to improve who you already are, rather than trying to become someone. This way you recognize your own imperfections and take the actions needed to even them out. Soon enough, this newfound identity you’re shaping will result in habits that positively reinforce your growth. Your efforts will materialize in outcomes and you’ll lose weight, write something or do whatever it is that you wanted to do in the first place. In summary, you’ll set yourself up for success. You might not achieve one or another thing in the short run, but you’ll never quit on your new endeavor because now it’s part of who you are!” Woah. Let that sink for a moment. It took me 2 weeks to internalize this!\n\n\nConclusion:\nSo, what’s the main takeaway and how does it all tie back to my efforts of writing blogs? What Tom taught me is to “be”, rather than “become”. The hardest part about setting out on a new journey is starting and setting yourself up for success. By accepting that you are already a writer, a runner etc. you’ll eliminate the pressure of becoming that someone. This, in turn, allows you to shift your perspective towards improving yourself. In short, don’t try hard, try smart. Remember, the following:\n\nGoal-based efforts can only get you so far\nIdentity-based efforts are a surefire way to succeed in the long run\nAsk “Why?” before you start\nBuild habits and results will follow\n\n\n\nGratefulness:\n\nThank you, Tom Munk, for opening my eyes to this fundamental truth about any effort whatsoever in life. I’m back on track and I don’t plan on derailing. I owe you a lot and I’m planning on repaying it fully!\nThank you, Andrei Neagoie, for teaching me about the truths about learning, habits and compound learning."

Now, after reading, I take some time to reflect and write. My writing is guided by a few simple rules that help me stay focused. Here are the rules that help me produce 1 mini-essay per day:\n\nStick to 1 idea and 1 idea only\nKeep it short:\n\nTime limit: 10-20 minutes\nWord limit: 100-500 words\nPage limit: The essay should be visible on one page without the need to scroll\n\nKeep the essays organized\n\nUse a Kanban board to track the process through all stages from raw idea to published\nInclude Tags and Folders for easy retrieval\nLink to other ideas that are relevant (Maybe your own past posts)\nReferences (Where did you get this idea? What prompted it? Books, videos, articles)\n\nThe three part structure:\n\nIntro\n\nTry any of the following: Introduce curiosity with a Hook / Be clear about the Premise / Use a bold statement / ask a provoking question / evoke strong emotions / throw the reader straight into the action by means of a story\n\nBody\n\nAnswer the premise of the intro\nOptional: Try a Story Note (use story telling to bring a point across)\n\nChoose the point you’re trying to make\nAmplify the message by choosing an illustrative story\nFor hard topics depersonalize the story by using non human characters or humor\n\n\nConclusion\n\nKeep it short and simple (KISS) - 1 or 2 sentences\n\n\nFeedback (3 sanity checks)\n\nRead the essay out loud to assess how it flows. This is an unreasonably powerful tool to quickly notice and change odd sentences\nAsk an AI to rate the essay & provide feedback on how to improve it\n\nHere’s my custom GPT - Mini Essay Critic\n\nAsk another person for feedback and written comments\nOptional: Wait a few days to let the idea simmer before returning to it with fresh eyes and doing a few last changes.\n\nOptional: Include an illustration\n\nMake a custom graphic for more important posts (with Excalidraw, Figma or Miro) or\nUse an existing graphic if\n\nPreserving precision of information is important (e.g. data plots) or\nCreating a custom graphic would be prohibitively time intensive\n\n\n\nFollowing these simple rules can transform your writing routine into a structured and productive daily habit.\n\n\nReferences"

    "text": "Babies are Like Tripping Adults\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine experiencing every sight, sound, and sensation as if for the first time. Are children, with their fresh perspectives, untainted by experience, more conscious than adults? This essay explores the intriguing similarity between children’s heightened perceptions and those reported by adults under the influence of psychedelics.\nTo begin exploring this idea, we’ll define consciousness as having a sense of self coupled with the ability to perceive. Let’s first delve into perception.\nPerception is the ability to accurately experience the stream of information we’re exposed to. Our perception is influenced by our attention, which comes in two forms: lantern attention (broad and diffused) and spotlight attention (narrow and focused). While adults often rely on spotlight attention to filter and focus, children may utilize more lantern attention, taking in a wider array of stimuli.\nThese two states of attention are linked to the activity levels in the brain’s default mode network (DMN), which is most active during normal adult waking consciousness. To visualize this, think of adult brains as cities connected by roads: a network of sparsely connected nodes with a few high-traffic highways and many smaller roads within any given city.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simplified view of the brain network changes caused by psilocybin compared to a placebo. The two diagrams (a and b) compare brain connections under both conditions, focusing on the strongest connections. Different colors represent brain regions, with connection size and thickness indicating strength. Under psilocybin, connections between regions are more numerous and stronger, suggesting increased brain integration. Image from Petri et al. 2014\n\n\n\nHaving experienced the world more extensively, adult brains, for better or worse, form shortcuts - high-traffic intercity highways. By leveraging their mental model of the world, these shortcuts help adults make sense of information and act quickly without exerting much energy. This is known as predictive coding. But these shortcuts also come at the cost of perceiving information less accurately.\nScientific studies indicate that psychedelics reduce DMN activity, increasing connectivity between brain regions (Pollan, 2018). This loosening of DMN control allows novel thinking patterns, as brain areas communicate more freely. It is akin to a shift from spotlight to lantern attention. For example, a study by Carhart-Harris et al. (2014) showed that psychedelics like psilocybin disrupt the DMN, enhancing sensory perception and cognitive flexibility.\nIn young children, the DMN is less developed and less active, correlating with a less pronounced sense of self. This reduced DMN activity means children are less focused on past and future selves. The “I” of small children is constrained to the present. They plan, daydream, reflect and ruminate less. This could explain why children exhibit spontaneous, uninhibited behavior and a heightened sense of wonder.\nChildren, like tripping adults possess a heightened ability to perceive reality, due to their less pronounced sense of self and more diffused attention. Temporarily disarming the default mode network may afford us a fresh look at the world free from the constraints of the mental models we have constructed over time."

    "text": "Wealth comes from leverage\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do some people grow wealthy while others don’t? The secret lies in one powerful principle: leverage. Leverage is the key that multiplies effort and amplifies outcomes, creating a clear path to wealth.\nConsider Bobby, a tireless waiter, who grinds through grueling 80-hour workweeks, yet his relentless efforts scarcely reflect in his paycheck. Bobby’s hard work is constrained by the limited leverage of his position — his income is directly tied to the hours he puts in.\nNow, let’s look at Tim, the savvy owner of the restaurant where Bobby works. Tim toiled tirelessly to establish his business. Now, the daily grind falls to his dedicated staff. By delegating essential tasks to employees like Bobby, Tim has effectively cloned himself, liberating his time for new ventures.\nTim’s friend Nina has taken leverage to new heights; she commands a thriving restaurant empire, with scores of managers overseeing a bustling workforce of hundreds of waiters and kitchen staff. By scaling her business, Nina amplifies her leverage — each new restaurant adds to her income without a proportional increase in her time investment.\nNina’s friend James, a tech wizard, revolutionized the dining experience with his ingenious food delivery app. This digital marvel enables people like Bobby to effortlessly order from Tim’s or any of Nina’s restaurants, with transactions seamlessly handled by the software. James’ creation operates on autopilot, effortlessly scaling from ten to a thousand restaurants without demanding more of his time.\nTo fuel his startup, James secured funding from Julia, a shrewd Venture Capitalist. Julia expertly allocates capital, placing strategic bets on promising companies with the hope of multiplying her investments. Her diverse portfolio boasts around 500 companies, including ten similar food delivery apps, reflecting her knack for spotting lucrative opportunities.\nBobby, Tim, Nina, James, and Julia all have the same 24 hours in a day, yet their use of leverage dramatically differentiates their wealth and success. While Bobby’s income remains tethered to his time, the others have found ways to multiply their efforts through delegation, scaling, technology, and investments. Leverage is the ultimate force multiplier in wealth creation. So, ask yourself: how are you leveraging your time?"

    "text": "To overcome these challenges, we can use proxies to narrow our search:\n\n\nParadoxically, it is probably easier to find an A* player than an A or B player. This is due to the power law distribution of talent and achievement, where the higher you get to the top of any field, the less crowded it usually becomes.\nAction: Defer to the Top\n\nIdentify the Top Contributors: Start by identifying the most important contributors in a field.\nPrioritize Effort: Only move to the next rank if no progress is made with the top candidates after considerable effort.\n\n\n\n\nA players tend to associate with other A players. Identify one noed to tap into their network of excellence.\nAction: Defer to Other A Players\n\nIdentify a Key A Player: Find at least one person who exhibits the desired qualities, ideally someone you already know.\nAsk for References: Request references and build relationships with these individuals.\nRepeat the Process: Habitually ask, “Who is the most impressive person you know who does X, and why?” and seek introductions.\n\n\n\n\nA players are often involved in high-impact projects that exemplify the quality of work you seek.\nAction: Defer to Impressive Projects\n\nIdentify Exemplary Projects: Find projects that reflect the quality of work you desire.\nContact Key Contributors: Reach out to the individuals responsible for these projects, such as first authors on scientific papers or engineering leads behind notable products.\nLeverage Your Network: Ask existing A players to help identify impressive projects.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough entrepreneurial individuals exist in large organizations, they are often harder to identify due to internal hurdles. In contrast, their contributions are more visible in smaller companies.\nAction: Defer to Small High-Performance Companies\n\nIdentify Traction-Driven Startups or Nonprofits : Look for startups with traction, but avoid being swayed by hype.\nReach Out to Key Players: Contact individuals working in these startups, usually less than 15 people.\n\nTo conclude, constrain your search space for A players by deferring to the top, other A players, impressive projects, and small high-performance companies. This strategy aims to reduce false positives, decreasing the pool of potential candidates while enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the hiring process."

    "text": "It Matters Who Is Telling Your Story\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever wondered how differently your life could be perceived through someone else’s eyes? Stop for a second and marvel at the fact most of life is up to subjective interpretation. Consider these two accounts:\n“I am boring. I wake up at the same time every morning. I drink the same brand of coffee, do the same exercise routine, shop at the same supermarket, and take the same road to work. I am a senior accountant at a large firm. Just a tiny cog in an indifferent system. I suck.”\n“My dad is amazing. He is so disciplined and consistent. He never fails to get up at 6:00 to prepare coffee and the most delicious family breakfast. His tall and handsome frame make him look like Superman when he puts on his suit for work. I admire how strong he is, especially when he carries four shopping bags from the car to the kitchen in one go. He makes a lot of important decisions at work, leading a team of ten people. He’s my hero.”\nBoth of these accounts describe the same person, yet they take vastly different perspectives. It can be transformative to renew your sense of self by deliberately adopting a different viewpoint. Who is in charge of your story now? Are you over-relying on a rotten self-image or skewed opinion others hold of you? Take a different vantage point to reinvent yourself without remaking yourself.\nIdentify who is telling your story and how they are doing it. It matters more than you think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspiration\n\n\n\nThis piece was inspired by “How to Change Your Mind” (p. 413), where Michael Pollan writes about a type of naturally occurring mystical experience called savikalpa samadhi, in the context of astronauts seeing the “Pale Blue Dot” for the first time. This is also known as the overview effect.\n\n“[…] the ego vanishes when confronted with the immensity of the universe during the course of a meditation on an object—in this case, planet Earth.”"

    "text": "Learn to Write to Learn\n\n\n\n\n\nRapid learning is essential in many fields, and one of the most effective methods to accelerate your learning process is through writing.\nMany thinkers and doers, such as Tim Ferris, Jordan Peterson, William Zinsser, Scott Young) and Thomas Frank have emphasized the importance of writing as a tool for learning. These individuals are celebrated for their ability to distill and communicate complex ideas clearly, a skill honed through consistent writing.\nWhat makes writing to learn so powerful?\n\nIt exposes gaps in your reasoning. Writing forces you to lay out your thoughts in a structured manner, revealing any inconsistencies or gaps. For instance, when you try to explain a concept in writing, you may realize that you don’t fully understand certain aspects, prompting you to investigate further.\nIt invites feedback. Writing makes your thoughts accessible to others, enabling you to receive constructive feedback. By sharing your written work, you invite others to critique and improve your ideas, which can lead to deeper understanding and refinement of your thoughts.\nIt provides a track record. Maintaining a written record of your thoughts and ideas allows you to track your intellectual progress over time. You may find that your understanding evolves significantly, and looking back at your earlier writings can highlight how much you’ve grown. This reflection can be both humbling and motivating.\n\nEmbrace the practice of writing as a powerful tool for learning. By articulating your thoughts and ideas through writing, you not only enhance your understanding but also pave the way for continuous intellectual growth.\nIn other words, learn to write so that you can write to learn."

    "text": "Two ways of reading - Book Buffet\n\n\n\n\n\nYou probably read books like you eat dinner. One plate at a time. What if you could sample different books, savoring a variety of ideas just like you would at a buffet? I’m inviting you to try a book buffet.\nOur ordinary way of consuming books is linear: start at the beginning and read to the end. Progress is often measured in pages read or books completed. But what if there was a more enjoyable way?\nImagine being given 10 plates of your 5 favorite dishes but being forced to eat one dish at a time until all 10 plates are gone before moving on to the next dish. While some might enjoy devouring 10 pizzas, most of us would quickly grow tired of it. This approach would make even our favorite foods turn into a soul crushing event with the potential for inducing serious PTSD.\nInstead, consider a book buffet. Just as you wouldn’t eat the same dish for every meal for weeks on end, try varying your reading. Sample different books during the week, within the same day or heck, even during the same sitting.\nHere’s how you can start your own book buffet:\n\nGather several books - Choose a diverse selection that piques your interest.\nRead the synopsis - Grab the first book and read the cover to get a feel for the theme.\nSkim the table of contents - Look for sections that catch your eye.\nStart reading - Dive into the interesting section you identified.\nInterrupt - Stop reading whenever you want to\n\nReflect\nTake a break\nReturn to step 3\n\nSwitch books when saturated - If you want to try a different taste, put the book aside and pick up another.\nRepeat - Start from Step 2 with a different book.”\n\nQuick tips: To make the most of your book buffet, start with a small selection - three to six books is ideal. This allows you to give each book enough attention without feeling overwhelmed. Don’t feel guilty if one book captivates you more than the others. Allow yourself to drown in a single book if it really speaks to you and be ruthless with books that don’t excite you; it’s all part of the experience. Remember to timebox your reading sessions to avoid “book trance” unless that’s your goal.\nNext time you settle in for a reading session, consider turning it into a book buffet. Bon appétit!"

Words like “likely” or “unlikely” are meant to provide clarity, but do they really? Most statements carry a bit of uncertainty, and we use Words_of_estimative_probability to hint at how sure we are. But here’s the kicker: they often don’t do the job we intend them to.\nPicture this: you’re at a party, and someone says, “It’s likely to rain tomorrow.” What does “likely” mean to you? 60% chance? 80%? Should you start looking for your favorite rubber boots? After asking yourself, go ahead and ask others to translate “likely” into a probability. I bet you’ll make 2 discoveries:\n\nYour own answer will fall within a large range (you might think “likely” means 40%-60%).\nOthers’ ranges might not overlap much with yours (someone else might think “likely” means 15%-27%).\n\nIf the goal is to be precise about our level of uncertainty, then we’re clearly missing the mark if the words we use are ambiguous.\nWhat’s the remedy? Quantify your statements. Instead of saying “I think it’s almost certain that Anna will bake brownies for her birthday,” try saying “I think there’s a 90% chance Anna will bake brownies for her birthday.”\nIf precision is your goal, ditch the ambiguous “likely” or “possibly.” Instead, embrace clear probabilities. Next time you predict, try saying, “There’s an 80% chance,” and watch as your thinking and communication becomes undeniably sharper and more reliable."

    "text": "Respect your friends, create an FRM\n\nThe other day, I looked at my phone and was horrified to realize it had been 18 months since I last spoke to a once very dear friend. It’s a sinking feeling. I wondered, “How can we avoid drifting apart from friends?” and “What factors influence the strength of our relationships?”\nLet’s start by breaking down the key elements that shape our friendships:\n\n\\(T_i\\): The time (\\(T\\)) we spend together in any given interaction (\\(i\\)).\n\\(Q_i\\): The quality (\\(Q\\)) of that time in any given interaction (\\(i\\)).\n\\(t\\): The time elapsed since our last meeting.\n\\(d\\): A small decay factor representing how quickly the quality of friendship deteriorates over time.\n\nUsing these parameters, we can create a formula to quantify the quality of friendship (\\(F\\)):\n\\[\nF=\\frac{\\sum_{i} (T_i \\times Q_i)}{1 + d \\times t}\n\\]\nThis formula shows that to maintain high friendship quality, we need to spend meaningful time together regularly. In other words, \\(F\\) is high, if \\(T\\) is high and \\(Q\\) is high\nThis means we should have many interactions (\\(i\\)), spend ample time together during these interactions (\\(T\\)) and ensure that our interactions are meaningful and qualitative (\\(Q\\)). Intuitively, we already know this.\nHowever, life often gets in the way. We juggle work, family, and other commitments, and before we know it, weeks or even months have passed without any contact (\\(t\\) increases). The longer we go without connecting, the more our friendships deteriorate, especially if they’re not particularly strong to begin with (large deterioration factor \\(d\\)). This highlights the need for regular contact that matches the strength of our friendship.\nManaging friendships isn’t rocket science! We use sophisticated systems to track work tasks, so why not apply a similar approach to our personal lives? It doesn’t have to be so hard.\nEnter the Customer Relationship Management System (CRM). Think of your friends as valued customers and your friendship as a continuous business relationship. The joy you feel from sustained friendships is akin to positive cashflow from keeping your customers happy. Treat your most important friends like key accounts. Implement a Friend Relationship Management System (FRM) to keep track of your friendships.\nHere’s a design proposal. Don’t overdo it. Keep track of the simple things.\nTable 1: Friends\n\nName\nLast Contacted (Lookup Latest Date from Table 1: Interactions)\nIdeal interaction frequency\n\nWeekly\n(Optional: Biweekly)\nMonthly\nQuarterly\nSemiannual\n\nIdeal next interaction date (Last contacted + Ideal Interaction frequency)\n[Optional: List of Interaction Files (Linked to Table 2: Interactions)]\n[Optional: List of Interactions]\n\nTable 2: Interactions\n\n[Optional: Interaction File]\nName (Linked to Table 1: Friends)\nInteraction Date\n\nGive your friendships the respect they deserve. Start an FRM today and watch your business thrive. Ehm, I mean your friendships. Watch them thrive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOther interesting resources that helped shape the ideas in this post:\n\nSpaced Repetition - Herman Ebbinghaus\n\nhttps://ncase.me/remember/\n\nOdd types of friendships\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html\n\nUnreasonable Hospitality\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Unreasonable-Hospitality-Remarkable-Giving-People/dp/0593418573"
