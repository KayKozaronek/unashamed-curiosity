    "text": "Word2Vec is one of the most well-known word embedding algorithms. Although it has been succeeded in efficacy by more recent transformer-based algorithms like BERT and GPT, Word2Vec remains a valuable algorithm to understand. It was the first algorithm to produce word embeddings that captured both syntactic and semantic relationships between words, famously demonstrated by the “king - man + woman = queen” analogy. This made a profound contribution to natural language processing and kicked off a swath of impressive developments. In this post, we will take a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of Word2Vec. But before we do that, let’s first review why word embeddings are crucial for NLP tasks."

    "section": "Continous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)",
    "text": "Continous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)\nIn both CBOW and Skip-Gram, we differentiate between center and context words. The context words around the center word are limited by a context window, which was exactly 4 in the paper. This means that there are 4 context words preceeding (history) and 4 (future) following the center word. The choice of this parameter was not explained in the paper and one might actually want to tune it.\nLet’s look at a specific example but instead of using 4, let’s use a context window of 2 words. Here, the center Word “ChatGPT” is surrounded by the context words “GPT-4”, “outperforms”, “in”, “general”.\n\n\n\nThe difference between CBOW and Skip-Gram is what we actually want to predict. While CBOW uses the context words to predict the center word, Skip-Gram does the opposite and predicts the context words from the center word.\n\n\n\nBy now, we have a good high-level overview of Word2Vec. It is time to move to the technical implementation of CBOW. We will first look at the trainable weight matrices and an illustrative forward and backward pass. Later, we will interpret the more math-heavy part, the loss function.\n\nIllustrated Forward and Backward Pass\nThere are 2 trainable weight matrices: the input and output matrix.\n\nN denotes the number of embedding dimensions,\nV the vocabulary size.\n\nN is usually 50-300 and V in the Google News Dataset, as mentioned before, 3M.\nThe input weight matrix is tasked with generating the input embedding for the task, while the output matrix will produce the predictions i.e. probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. This will make more sense in a bit. For now what is crucial to understand, is that each token has an embedding in the input word matrix. This will be its context embedding. Additionally each token has an embedding in the output word matrix which is its center embedding. In other words, each word has 2 embeddings. The tokens in the Vocabulary need to be mapped to indices, so we can look up their embeddings in the input or output matrices using indexing.\n\nFun Fact: Zyzzyva is an actual word and refers to a type of weevils. I asked Google: “What is the last item in English dictionaries.”\n\n\n\n\nLet’s put all we know together by illustrating the forward and backward pass! Below, we use the same example of center and context words.\n\nUsing the token-index mapping, we look up the indices of the center and context words.\nThe 4 context words are taken from the input matrix and stacked horizontally.\nTo get the average context, we take the row-wise average of the context word embeddings.\nUsing the output (center) matrix, we calculate the dot product between each word in the vocabulary and the averaged context embedding. This is a matrix-vector multiplication. In the resulting score vector each item refers to the similarity (dot product) between the average context and the words in the vocabulary.\nTo get a probability distribution over the vocabulary, we apply softmax normalization.\nThe y_true vector will be OHE where the single non-zero element is at the index of the center word.\nFinally, we apply Cross-Entropy loss and apply backprop to calculate the gradients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective Function Explained\nNow that we have a better understanding of the forward and backward pass of CBOW, let’s examine the math. Actually, the math of the “vanilla” Word2Vec is not too convoluted, we just need to dissect the objective function.\n\nQuick disclaimer: you won’t find these functions in the original paper. Here, I am making use of [2] and [3] but I make an effort at simplyfying the notation and provide a more detailed explanation.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the data likelihood i.e. to maximize the probability of a center word \\(w_{t-1}\\) conditioned on the context words in context window of c \\(w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}\\), a given parameter set of \\(\\theta\\) which is the context and center embedding matrices. \\(T\\) denotes the tokens of the dataset i.e. all the words in the dataset.\n\\[\n\\text{Likelihood} = L(\\theta) =  \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}; \\theta)\n\\]\nHow do we calculate \\(P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c})\\)? We are yet to inject the word embeddings into these functions because now they refer to words. In section “Illustrated Forward and Backward Pass”, we said that each word has a corresponding context (input) and center (output) word vector. Let’s denote the context word matrix as \\(K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times |V|}\\) where \\(k_{i}\\) refers to the i-th column of K meaning the context embedding of word at index i. The center word matrix is denoted by \\(U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V| \\times n}\\) where center word embeddings are stacked row-wise. Similarly, \\(u_{i}\\) refers to the i-th row of U indicating the center embedding of word at index i.\nLet’s now write up how to express \\(P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c})\\) using the contex and center word embeddings and then explain it in more detail. Below \\(u_{t}\\) refers to the context embedding of the context word at position t. \\(\\bar{k_{c}}\\) refers to the average context embedding of the context words. By taking the dot product between these two, we get a similarity metric (an unnormalized one) between the center word and the average context. The higher the dot-product the more similar the vectors are i.e. the vectors point to a similar direction.\n\n\n\nBy calculating the dot product between all center word embedding and the average context embedding in the vocabulary (the denominator) and applying softmax, we get a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary.\n\\[P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}) = \\frac{exp(u_{t}\\bar{k_{c}})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}exp(u_{w}\\bar{k_{c}})}\\]\nIn machine learning, it is easier to work with the dual problem of maximizing likelihood which is minimizing the negative log likelihood. Using this trick makes the optimization easier. If you want to know why, I recommend reading this thread. Take the log of the product term results in the summation of logs. By convention, we optimize for the average log-likelihood, hence taking \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nJ(\\theta) & = -\\frac{1}{T} \\log L(\\theta) \\\\\n& = -\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\log P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+c}; \\theta)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOkay, so now we got a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary which is the prediction of the model but how do we relate this to the ground truth? The cost function does not (yet) include the y_true term though we use it for the cross-entropy loss calculation in the forward pass chart! I just left out this part from the cost function definition to not to make the formula too difficult to understand. The correct loss function for a given sample (a center word and its context) J is:\n\\[J = -\\sum_{w=1}^{V} y_{w}log(\\hat{y}_{w})\\]\nwhere\n\\[\\hat{y} = \\frac{exp(u_{t}\\bar{k_{c}})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}exp(u_{w}\\bar{k_{c}})}\\]\nSince the target, y vector is OHE, J reduces to where the i index refers to the target element of the target vector e.g. the index of “ChatGPT” as in the example:\n\\[J = -y_{i}log(\\hat{y_{i}})\\]\nWe can extend the formula to contain all training samples of the dataset but this is pretty much all about the CBOW version of Word2Vec. Except for one last thing. In the next section, we will review the training algorithm and point out its computation complexity and 2 methods that reduce the computational complexity: Negative Sampling and Hierarchical Softmax."

    "text": "Skip-Gram\nSkip-Gram flips the role of the context and center words. Here, the center word is used as input to predict the context (output) words. The forward and backward pass are illustrated below in a similar fashion as for CBOW. Observe the differences between the two architectures. Here, the input matrix is the one containing the center word embeddings, the output contains the context ones. We use the center word representation as input to calcute scores for the context outputs. Just like in CBOW, we make a softmax prediction over the entire vocabulary but we contrast these predictions against the multiple target context words which is indicated by the grey box on the right. In this example, we predict the 4 context words from the center.\n\n\n\nFor ease of notation, only a single sample’s training objective will be detailed. Let’s first start with the likelihood function again. Here, we aim to maximize the probability of context words conditioned on the center word. If we denote context lenght with c, there are 2c context words of which probabilities we aim to maximize (c history and c future context words).\n\\[\\text{Likelihood}=L(\\theta) =\\prod_{j=1}^{2c}P(w_{j} \\mid w_t; \\theta)\\]\nIt is important to note that the formula implies that we make a strong conditional independence assumption. Given a center word, all output words are completely independent (hence you can simply multiply the probabilities). This is definitely not true. Just think of simple grammar. If you have a noun center word followed by a verb context, then the upcoming context is quite unlikely to be a verb again. To give you an example, if you have the word Chelsea (a famous football club and also a district in London) as the center followed be played context then the next context is less likely to be a verb like jump and more likely to be an adjective like marvelously. Seeing this example you may even give semantical arguments why the conditional independence does not hold like nouns more related to football e.g. game is more likely to come up than academics related nouns e.g. conference. Nonetheless, Skip-Gram manages to work well in practice, thus we may be okay with this. By the way, it is the very same assumption that the Naive Bayes Classifier model makes. This naive assumption lets us to break out probabilities so we don’t have to deal with figuring out the joint distributions.\n[NOTE] I think an elaboration of this point may be useful\nThe softmax is used again to get the probability distribution over the vocabulary. Below \\(k_{t}\\) refers to the center word embedding while \\(u_{c}\\) to the context word embedding. This is the opposite of what we have seen in CBOW.\n\\[P(w_{j} \\mid w_t) = \\frac{\\exp(u_{j}k_{t})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})}\\]\nIf you take the negative log-likelihood for a single context word, given a center:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nJ & = -\\log P(w_{j} \\mid w_t) \\\\\n& = -\\log\\frac{\\exp(u_{j}k_{t})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})} \\\\\n& = -\\left[\\log \\exp(u_{j}k_{t}) - \\log\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})\\right] \\\\\n& = -\\left[u_{j}k_{t} -  \\log\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})\\right]\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nExpanding it to all context words:\n\\[ J = -\\sum_{j=1}^{2m}\\left[{u_{j}}{k_t} -log\\sum_{w=1}^{V}\\exp(u_{w}k_{t})\\right]\\]\nBy now, we have grokked the two versions of the Word2Vec algorithms. One detail is still missing though. As it was pointed out, each word has context and one center embedding. How to make one of them? Just simply average them! Next, let’s review some practical limitations and their remedies."

    "section": "Expensive Softmax and Alternatives",
    "text": "Expensive Softmax and Alternatives\nNote that in the softmax normalization, we normalize over the entire vocabulary which is huge. Its comoutational complexity is linear, \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\). In the case of Google News dataset it is ca. 6M tokens! Even if you have optimized, vectorized implementation of the softmax calculation, it would take very long to calculate the softmax for each sample in the dataset. As mentioned before, the 2 other innovations of Word2Vec, Hierarchical Softmax and Negative Sampling aim at this computational issue. To limit the scope of this blog post, we will only elaborate on Negative Sampling. While Negative sampling is a more straightforward concept and computationally more efficient, the results of Hierarchical Softmax are not better.\nAt this point I want to point out a little confusion on my part. Though in the first [1] paper, the authors introduced both Skip-Gram and CBOW, in the second they only proceeded with Skip-Gram without any explanation. At least I could not find any. The results in the first paper did not suggest any superiority of Skip-Gram. If you understand this decision, please let me know! :) Anyway, I will proceed in the same way as the authors did and use Skip-Gram accordingly.\n\nNegative Sampling\nThe idea of negative sampling, which was actually introduced in the second Word2Vec paper [2], is simple: instead of contrasting a given center and context word embedding pair against the entire vocabulary, why don’t we just contrast it against noise? In other words, what we aim here is to assess the probability that the center and context words came from the data. The trick is that we ingest negative (or fake if you like) context words so that we expect the model to tell these apart. If I have the center OpenAI and chatGPT as context, I want to assign high probability to this pair but low to a random pair like OpenAI and dachshund or OpenAI and daisy. We use k such negative samples for each positive one. The authors recommend 2-5 negative samples for bigger while 5-20 in smaller datasets. The likelihood function is given as below. \\(w_{t}\\) denotes the center, \\(w_{j}\\) the context word. The tilde marks the negative context sample.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Likelihood} & = P(D=1| w_{j}, w_{t}) \\prod_{i=1}^{K}P(D = 0| \\tilde{w_{j_i}}, w_{t}) \\\\\n& =  P(D=1) \\prod_{i=1}^{K}(1 - P(D = 1 | \\tilde{w_{j_i}}, w_{t}))\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWord2Vec uses the sigmoid function to model probability and for similarity we again use the dot product. Recall that \\(k_{t}\\) refers to the center word embedding while \\(u_{j}\\) to the context word embedding \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Likelihood} & = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u_{j} k_{t})} \\prod_{i=1}^{K} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u_{j_i} k_{t})}\\right) \\\\\n& =  \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u_{j} k_{t})} \\prod_{i=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(u_{j_i} k_{t})}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAgain, taking the negative log likelihood (NLL) as traning objective:\n\\[J = - log  \\frac{1}{1 + exp(-u_{j} k_{t})} - \\sum_{i=1}^{K} log \\frac{1}{1 + exp(u_{j_i} k_{t})}\\]\nIt seems that we have a loss function so we are all set! Almost… We still need to figure out how to draw negative samples i.e. define \\(P(\\tilde{w_{j_i}})\\). One might think of using a uniform distribution but that does not take into account word frequencies that we may want to take into consideration. The authors recommend using a scaled version of the unigram distribution \\(U(w)\\) (model based on word frequencies). They found empirically that the unigram distribution raised to the power of 3/4 \\(U(w)^{3/4}\\) works best. To build some intuition why this may be a particularly useful setting, let’s look at the below table of example. We have a 3 words, one is very frequent (at), another less frequent (cinema) and an infrequent one (dachshund). If we raise their relative frequencies to 3/4, then relatively, the infrequent dachshund gets 3x more frequent, cinema 1.7 while at only 1.5. You can see that by using this scaled version of unigram distribution for negative sampling, we increase the probability of drawing less frequent words on the expense of more frequent ones. This intuitively makes sense because without this, we may be drawing too similar negative samples e.g. “the, it” which does not seem to be noise, against we want to contrast the word embeddings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nRelative frequency - \\(f(x)\\)\nRe-scaled relative frequency - \\(f(x)^{3/4}\\)\n\n\n\n\nat\n0.3\n0.45\n\n\ncinema\n0.1\n0.17\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\ndachshund\n0.01\n0.03"

    "text": "Subsampling of frequent words\nAnother trick that Word2Vec applies to put less emphasis on frequent words is subsampling. The authors argue that words like “in”, “the”, and “a” occur hundreds of millions of times in a large corpus of text. The co-occurence of these words arguably does not provide any useful information with other words e.g. “Paris”. However, the co-occurrence of other words e.g. “Paris” and “France” has immense useful information. Thus, it seems plausible to subsample the frequent words which speeds up training by skipping a share of the frequent word samples. Below, \\(P(x)\\) denotes the probability of x being skippend, \\(f(x)\\) the frequency of the word, \\(t\\) is a chosen threshold recommended to be around \\(10^{-5}\\). It is obvious that infrequent words will have very high probability of being picked. Frequent words are more likely to be skipped but this may be offset by a higher choice of \\(t\\) hyperparameter.\n\\[ P(x) = 1 -  \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{f(x)}}\\]"

    "text": "Other notes\nThough this has been quite an in-depth Word2Vec explainer, there is still a lot more to explore within and beyond the scope of Word2vec. I am going to just share a few more things in an unstructured way. You may decide to explore any of these in more detail.\n\nHyperparameters\nThroughout the post, I tried to point out the recommended range of hyperparameters. [8] provides further comments and tips by the authors.\nRecommended HPs: - Embedding size: 50-300 - Context size: 5-10 - Algorithm: Skip-gram/ CBOW - #negative samples: 2-5 (if dataset big enough) if using Negative Sampling and not Hierarchical Softmax - Epochs: 1-3 - Subsampling threshold \\(t\\): ca. \\(10^{-5}\\)\nThe paper does not touch upon what optimizer to use but one might benefit from using an adaptive one like Adam. This might make sense because we may want to apply larger updates to less frequent words.\n\n\nDataset\nThe quality of the dataset is maybe more important than the specific HP settings we choose. The paper used the proprietary Google News dataset but there are now much bigger datasets! Just look at how GloVe [8] benefits from larger and better datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\nEvaluating word vectors is an interesting task. There are 2 ways to do this: 1) intrinsic and 2) extrinsic. In intrinsic evaluation, typically, we do some kind of arithmetic of word embeddings and contrast it to our expectations. There are word similarity and analogy datasets that have been curated by humans. The authors open-sourced their own datasets for intrinsic evaluation: link. It contains semantic and syntactic analogies like “Athens-Greece+Madrid=Spain” and “occasional-occasionally+amazing=amazingly” In extrinsic evaluation, we see how the word embeddings influence the performance of downstream applications where these are used as inputs. Note, that the latter is less sterile because we not only expect “good” word embeddings but also a good interaction between them and the downstream-specific application algorithm.\n\n\nBias\nSince Word2Vec is trained on large corpus of data, it will be exposed of all the biases that surround us. Just think about how more often it will see male references to politicians or engineers and much less for kingergarten teacher or nurse. This begs loads of ethical questions and for solutions. This is a very important topic and I might devote more time to explore it more in a follow-up post. For now, you can take a look at [10] for more details or the “Bias and overgeneralization” part of [11]."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Two ways of reading - Book Buffet\n\n\n\n\n\nYou probably read books like you eat dinner. One plate at a time. What if you could sample different books, savoring a variety of ideas just like you would at a buffet? I’m inviting you to try a book buffet.\nOur ordinary way of consuming books is linear: start at the beginning and read to the end. Progress is often measured in pages read or books completed. But what if there was a more enjoyable way?\nImagine being given 10 plates of your 5 favorite dishes but being forced to eat one dish at a time until all 10 plates are gone before moving on to the next dish. While some might enjoy devouring 10 pizzas, most of us would quickly grow tired of it. This approach would make even our favorite foods turn into a soul crushing event with the potential for inducing serious PTSD.\nInstead, consider a book buffet. Just as you wouldn’t eat the same dish for every meal for weeks on end, try varying your reading. Sample different books during the week, within the same day or heck, even during the same sitting.\nHere’s how you can start your own book buffet:\n\nGather several books - Choose a diverse selection that piques your interest.\nRead the synopsis - Grab the first book and read the cover to get a feel for the theme.\nSkim the table of contents - Look for sections that catch your eye.\nStart reading - Dive into the interesting section you identified.\nInterrupt - Stop reading whenever you want to\n\nReflect\nTake a break\nReturn to step 3\n\nSwitch books when saturated - If you want to try a different taste, put the book aside and pick up another.\nRepeat - Start from Step 2 with a different book.”\n\nQuick tips: To make the most of your book buffet, start with a small selection - three to six books is ideal. This allows you to give each book enough attention without feeling overwhelmed. Don’t feel guilty if one book captivates you more than the others. Allow yourself to drown in a single book if it really speaks to you and be ruthless with books that don’t excite you; it’s all part of the experience. Remember to timebox your reading sessions to avoid “book trance” unless that’s your goal.\nNext time you settle in for a reading session, consider turning it into a book buffet. Bon appétit!"

These individuals are celebrated for their ability to distill and communicate complex ideas clearly, a skill honed through consistent writing.\nWhat makes writing to learn so powerful?\n\nIt exposes gaps in your reasoning. Writing forces you to lay out your thoughts in a structured manner, revealing any inconsistencies or gaps. For instance, when you try to explain a concept in writing, you may realize that you don’t fully understand certain aspects, prompting you to investigate further.\nIt invites feedback. Writing makes your thoughts accessible to others, enabling you to receive constructive feedback. By sharing your written work, you invite others to critique and improve your ideas, which can lead to deeper understanding and refinement of your thoughts.\nIt provides a track record. Maintaining a written record of your thoughts and ideas allows you to track your intellectual progress over time. You may find that your understanding evolves significantly, and looking back at your earlier writings can highlight how much you’ve grown. This reflection can be both humbling and motivating.\n\nEmbrace the practice of writing as a powerful tool for learning. By articulating your thoughts and ideas through writing, you not only enhance your understanding but also pave the way for continuous intellectual growth.\nIn other words, learn to write so that you can write to learn."

According to Ray Dalio, success isn’t about luck — it’s about following a clear, five-step process. Inspired by his principles, I’ve added a crucial sixth step: reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote how this parallels some of the ideas outlined in Bare Bones Strategy - A Triad.\n\n\n\n1. Define Your Goal\nBe clear about what you want to achieve. Forget practicalities and obstacles for now. Interestingly, larger goals can be more attainable than smaller ones. Be specific, set a deadline, and quantify your goals as much as possible.\n\n\n2. Encounter Problems\nAs you strive towards your goal, barriers will naturally arise. This is indispensable when pursuing ambitious goals. Don’t let these obstacles deter you. Note every problem and assess them clearly.\n\n\n3. Understand the Problems\nSolving a problem requires understanding its root cause. Identify the mechanisms at play that either create or perpetuate the issue. Once you grasp the moving parts, you’re better equipped to devise a solution.\n\n\n4. Devise a Solution\nConfront the difficult aspects of the problem directly. Ask yourself: What is the most straightforward way to resolve this issue? Prioritize actions that offer the greatest leverage.\n\n\n5. Implement the Solution\nPlans are meaningless without action. Execute the solutions you’ve devised diligently.\n\n\n6. Reflect on the Process\nAfter implementing your solution, take time to reflect on the entire process. Identify where you struggled and how you can improve. Seek feedback from others and give yourself constructive criticism. Remember, “Learning doesn’t come from experience; it comes from reflecting on experience.”\nSuccess is built on a few fundamental steps. By defining your goals, diagnosing problems, devising solutions, and reflecting on your journey, you can turn any ambition into reality. Use this process as your roadmap to success and watch your actions transform into achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the original here:"

    "text": "Respect your friends, create an FRM\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other day, I looked at my phone and was horrified to realize it had been 18 months since I last spoke to a once very dear friend. It’s a sinking feeling. It made me wonder: “How can we avoid drifting apart from friends?” and “What factors influence the strength of our relationships?”\nSince I’m a geek we’ll start by breaking down the key elements that shape our friendships:\n\n\\(T_i\\): The time (\\(T\\)) we spend together in any given interaction (\\(i\\)).\n\\(Q_i\\): The quality (\\(Q\\)) of that time in any given interaction (\\(i\\)).\n\\(t\\): The time elapsed since our last meeting.\n\\(d\\): A small decay factor representing how quickly the quality of friendship deteriorates over time.\n\nUsing these parameters, we can create a formula to quantify the quality of friendship (\\(F\\)):\n\\[\nF=\\frac{\\sum_{i} (T_i \\times Q_i)}{1 + d \\times t}\n\\]\nThis formula shows that to maintain high friendship quality, we need to spend meaningful time together regularly. In other words, \\(F\\) is high, if \\(T\\) is high and \\(Q\\) is high\nThis means we should have many interactions (\\(i\\)), spend ample time together during these interactions (\\(T\\)) and ensure that our interactions are meaningful and qualitative (\\(Q\\)). Intuitively, we already know this.\nHowever, life often gets in the way. We juggle work, family, and other commitments, and before we know it, weeks or even months have passed without any contact (\\(t\\) increases). The longer we go without connecting, the more our friendships deteriorate, especially if they’re not particularly strong to begin with (large deterioration factor \\(d\\)). This highlights the need for regular contact that matches the strength of our friendship.\nManaging friendships isn’t rocket science! We use sophisticated systems to track work tasks, so why not apply a similar approach to our personal lives? It doesn’t have to be so hard.\nEnter the Customer Relationship Management System (CRM). Think of your friends as valued customers and your friendship as a continuous business relationship. The joy you feel from sustained friendships is akin to positive cashflow from keeping your customers happy. Treat your most important friends like key accounts. Implement a Friend Relationship Management System (FRM) to keep track of your friendships.\nHere’s a design proposal. Don’t overdo it. Keep track of the simple things.\n\nTable 1: Friends\n\nName\nLast Contacted (Lookup Latest Date from Table 2: Interactions)\nIdeal interaction frequency\n\nWeekly\n(Optional: Biweekly)\nMonthly\nQuarterly\nSemiannual\n\nIdeal next interaction date (Last contacted + Ideal Interaction frequency)\n[Optional: List of Interaction Files (Linked to Table 2: Interactions)]\n[Optional: List of Interactions]\n\n\n\nTable 2: Interactions\n\n[Optional: Interaction File]\nName (Linked to Table 1: Friends)\nInteraction Date\n\nGive your friendships the respect they deserve. Start an FRM today and watch your business thrive. Ehm, I mean your friendships. Watch them thrive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOther interesting resources that helped shape the ideas in this post:\n\nSpaced Repetition - Herman Ebbinghaus\n\nhttps://ncase.me/remember/\n\nOdd types of friendships\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html\n\nUnreasonable Hospitality\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Unreasonable-Hospitality-Remarkable-Giving-People/dp/0593418573"

He’s my hero.”\nBoth of these accounts describe the same person, yet they take vastly different perspectives. It can be transformative to renew your sense of self by deliberately adopting a different viewpoint. Who is in charge of your story now?

    "text": "Babies are Like Tripping Adults\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine experiencing every sight, sound, and sensation as if for the first time. Are children, with their fresh perspectives, untainted by experience, more conscious than adults? This essay explores the intriguing similarity between children’s heightened perceptions and those reported by adults under the influence of psychedelics.\nTo begin exploring this idea, we’ll define consciousness as having a sense of self coupled with the ability to perceive. Let’s first delve into perception.\nPerception is the ability to accurately experience the stream of information we’re exposed to. Our perception is influenced by our attention, which comes in two forms: lantern attention (broad and diffused) and spotlight attention (narrow and focused). While adults often rely on spotlight attention to filter and focus, children may utilize more lantern attention, taking in a wider array of stimuli.\nThese two states of attention are linked to the activity levels in the brain’s default mode network (DMN), which is most active during normal adult waking consciousness. To visualize this, think of adult brains as cities connected by roads: a network of sparsely connected nodes with a few high-traffic highways and many smaller roads within any given city.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simplified view of the brain network changes caused by psilocybin compared to a placebo. The two diagrams (a and b) compare brain connections under both conditions, focusing on the strongest connections. Different colors represent brain regions, with connection size and thickness indicating strength. Under psilocybin, connections between regions are more numerous and stronger, suggesting increased brain integration. Image from Petri et al. 2014\n\n\n\nHaving experienced the world more extensively, adult brains, for better or worse, form shortcuts - high-traffic intercity highways. By leveraging their mental model of the world, these shortcuts help adults make sense of information and act quickly without exerting much energy. This is known as predictive coding. But these shortcuts also come at the cost of perceiving information less accurately.\nScientific studies indicate that psychedelics reduce DMN activity, increasing connectivity between brain regions (Pollan, 2018). This loosening of DMN control allows novel thinking patterns, as brain areas communicate more freely. It is akin to a shift from spotlight to lantern attention. For example, a study by Carhart-Harris et al. (2014) showed that psychedelics like psilocybin disrupt the DMN, enhancing sensory perception and cognitive flexibility.\nIn young children, the DMN is less developed and less active, correlating with a less pronounced sense of self. This reduced DMN activity means children are less focused on past and future selves. The “I” of small children is constrained to the present. They plan, daydream, reflect and ruminate less. This could explain why children exhibit spontaneous, uninhibited behavior and a heightened sense of wonder.\nChildren, like tripping adults possess a heightened ability to perceive reality, due to their less pronounced sense of self and more diffused attention. Temporarily disarming the default mode network may afford us a fresh look at the world free from the constraints of the mental models we have constructed over time."

Words like “likely” or “unlikely” are meant to provide clarity, but do they really? Most statements carry a bit of uncertainty, and we use Words_of_estimative_probability to hint at how sure we are. But here’s the kicker: they often don’t do the job we intend them to.\nPicture this: you’re at a party, and someone says, “It’s likely to rain tomorrow.” What does “likely” mean to you? 60% chance? 80%? Should you start looking for your favorite rubber boots? After asking yourself, go ahead and ask others to translate “likely” into a probability. I bet you’ll make 2 discoveries:\n\nYour own answer will fall within a large range (you might think “likely” means 40%-60%).\nOthers’ ranges might not overlap much with yours (someone else might think “likely” means 15%-27%).\n\nIf the goal is to be precise about our level of uncertainty, then we’re clearly missing the mark if the words we use are ambiguous.\nWhat’s the remedy? Quantify your statements. Instead of saying “I think it’s almost certain that Anna will bake brownies for her birthday,” try saying “I think there’s a 90% chance Anna will bake brownies for her birthday.”\nIf precision is your goal, ditch the ambiguous “likely” or “possibly.” Instead, embrace clear probabilities.

    "text": "Wealth comes from leverage\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do some people grow wealthy while others don’t? The secret lies in one powerful principle: leverage. Leverage is the key that multiplies effort and amplifies outcomes, creating a clear path to wealth.\nConsider Bobby, a tireless waiter, who grinds through grueling 80-hour workweeks, yet his relentless efforts scarcely reflect in his paycheck. Bobby’s hard work is constrained by the limited leverage of his position — his income is directly tied to the hours he puts in.\nNow, let’s look at Tim, the savvy owner of the restaurant where Bobby works. Tim toiled tirelessly to establish his business. Now, the daily grind falls to his dedicated staff. By delegating essential tasks to employees like Bobby, Tim has effectively cloned himself, liberating his time for new ventures.\nTim’s friend Nina has taken leverage to new heights; she commands a thriving restaurant empire, with scores of managers overseeing a bustling workforce of hundreds of waiters and kitchen staff. By scaling her business, Nina amplifies her leverage — each new restaurant adds to her income without a proportional increase in her time investment.\nNina’s friend James, a tech wizard, revolutionized the dining experience with his ingenious food delivery app. This digital marvel enables people like Bobby to effortlessly order from Tim’s or any of Nina’s restaurants, with transactions seamlessly handled by the software. James’ creation operates on autopilot, effortlessly scaling from ten to a thousand restaurants without demanding more of his time.\nTo fuel his startup, James secured funding from Julia, a shrewd Venture Capitalist.

    "text": "A book - “How to Change Your Mind”\nThe journey began long before I booked the retreat or even decided that psychedelics could be a part of my life. It started with a book. Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” found its way into my hands almost serendipitously. It was hidden in the corner of a staircase library at my local coworking space and didn’t look like much. At first glance, it appeared to be a self-help book, and I thought, “Oh well, this one is a bit thick for a self-help book; perhaps there’s goodness in here.” If it wasn’t for the fact that I was doing a book buffet and picked up several books, I don’t think I would have bothered opening this one. Once I did, though, I got hooked.\nPollan’s meticulous research and eloquent prose about the transformative potential of psychedelics struck a chord with me. His exploration into the science, history, and personal narratives surrounding substances like LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline planted a seed of curiosity. Pollan’s balanced approach — acknowledging both the profound insights and the inherent risks — made the idea of a psychedelic journey seem both intriguing and plausible."

    "section": "Finding myself in a dark place",
    "text": "Finding myself in a dark place\nIn the months leading up to the retreat, I found myself in a dark place, grappling with a myriad of challenges that piled into an insurmountable mountain of physical and mental stress. My interest in psilocybin began with its medical applications for depression and terminally ill cancer patients. However, I soon wondered if this medicine could help me, an otherwise healthy individual, navigate my own dark night and find daylight.\nProfessionally, I was grappling with significant uncertainties and doubts about my career path, culminating in a burnout that compelled me to take a week off work and subsequently reduce my working hours for an entire month by 20%. The stagnation in progress at the nonprofit I founded left me feeling unfulfilled and incompetent, constantly questioning whether I was on the right track.\nPersonally, conflicts among loved ones left me in a constant state of mediation, significantly affecting my well-being. There’s nothing more effective at bringing you down than having two of the most significant people in your life fight, lose trust in each other, and break ties, leaving you as the only hair-thin string holding together the massive, bridgeless raft they created. Additionally, I had recently moved to Krakow and didn’t have many close in-person friends yet. Although it’s easy to make acquaintances, deep friendships take time to develop, and that time simply hadn’t passed yet. I was left with barely anyone to talk to.\nOn top of these professional and personal challenges, I was dealing with a profound sense of disconnection from my community. Before moving to Krakow, I lived in intellectually stimulating environments like London and Berkeley, surrounded by a network of like-minded rationalists, AI Safety researchers, and Effective Altruists. I felt out of sync with the world around me, unable to find a community in Krakow where I truly belonged. This feeling of alienation left me emotionally raw and vulnerable. My mental models and behaviors that were appreciated in my previous community suddenly turned into weird conversational artifacts that made it difficult to maintain meaningful connections. I was often left feeling isolated and misunderstood.\nIn addition to these psychological stressors, I had traveled a lot—on average eight days per month for six months—to different time zones and places all the while training for my first marathon. This left me physically challenged, adding additional, self-imposed and certainly positive but draining stressors. On top of that, I found out that I was going to be a father soon. The news hadn’t yet properly sunk in, begging more questions than answers. The weight of these issues felt like a crushing boulder on my chest, making each breath a struggle. I was constantly anxious and unable to find peace even in moments of quiet. My daily gratitude practice felt like a chore, and monitoring my composure became the only practical way to manage my anger outbursts. Every day felt like a battle against an invisible enemy, leaving me desperate for a way out of the darkness. In my search for relief, I began to explore radical solutions. A psychedelic retreat emerged as a beacon of hope, promising the clarity, new perspective, and reconnection with myself and the world that I desperately needed. Attending the retreat represented a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak and overwhelming landscape."

    "section": "Researching Various Retreats",
    "text": "Researching Various Retreats\nInspired by Michael Pollan’s detailed accounts of transformative psychedelic experiences, I embarked on a quest to find a retreat that would align with my personal needs and aspirations. The research process was extensive and demanding. I delved into countless online reviews, talked to 16 different retreat representatives, and scrutinized the qualifications of various facilitators.\nMy primary criteria included cost and the legal status of the retreat’s location. Secondary considerations were the type of psychedelic medicine used, retreat duration, the earliest available start date, and the rapport I felt with the facilitators. Unfortunately, in my eagerness, I overlooked the critical aspect of professionalism and underestimated how much attention I should have paid to the rapport I felt with the facilitators.\nI sought a retreat environment conducive to deep psychological exploration, one that offered robust support and expert guidance. After carefully weighing all my options, I chose a retreat in the Netherlands that promised a comprehensive approach: some pre-ceremony preparation, a guided psilocybin journey, and a post-ceremony integration sessions. It was a no-frills retreat that was reasonably priced at 240 Euros, significantly lower than most other retreats, which started at 1800 Euros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Purchasing Heuristic\n\n\n\nWhen faced with purchasing decisions for items I’m uncertain about, I typically choose the cheapest option. This approach allows me to test the product and determine if it meets my expectations. I evaluate how frequently I use it and whether it provides the desired value. Often, the inexpensive choice is flawed in some unanticipated ways, quickly revealing if an upgrade is necessary. If I decide to upgrade, I then select the best option available within my budget constraints.\n\n\nIn all sincerity, I was quite stressed about making the right choice, wary of saving on price at the potential expense of retreat quality. Using my General Purchasing Heuristic didn’t seem appropriate for an experience as important as this. What if I would have a bad trip? In addition, I was very nervous about choosing a retreat because I didn’t fully connect with either of the representatives of my final 2 options. Both seemed too “businessy” in their approach, treating me like a customer, which heightened my concerns about their sincerity and professionalism — concerns I should have heeded.\nMy partner advised that I might not be ready and suggested waiting before making a decision. Ultimately, I think it’s good that I went because postponing it might have led to never going at all. However, she was right about how rushed my final decision felt compared to my research. I spent a few days ruminating before deciding to attend a retreat scheduled for two weeks later. A day after my booking, it turned out that the retreat was already at full capacity, and I was offered a spot one week earlier instead. This left me feeling rushed and robbed of an additional week of mental preparation. These weren’t ideal conditions for retreat preparation, but I went ahead anyway. Soon enough, between booking flights, informing friends and family about my trip, and setting my intentions, the day of the retreat arrived."

    "section": "Day 1",
    "text": "Day 1\n\nPreparation and Travel - The 3 C’s\nThe day began with a sense of anticipation mixed with anxiety. At 03:30, I made my way to the airport for the early morning flight from Krakow to Amsterdam. The airport lobby buzzed with the pre-dawn rush, the smell of coffee and the distant hum of announcements filling the air as I sat, pen in hand, revisiting my intentions for the retreat: Clarity, Confidence, and Composure. These “3 C’s” were meant to guide me through the myriad of challenges in my life. I was mentally preparing for what I hoped would be a profound journey. To solidify my intentions, I wrote out the thoughts swirling in my mind. uestions about my personal life took center stage:\n\nHow should I prioritize the many challenges in my life? What do I want to work on? How can I give my child the best life possible? Where do I belong? What do I value? Why am I so obsessed with excellence? What do I really believe when it comes to AGI? How can I retrain friendships and build new strong connections?\n\nAs I wrote, I realized I was struggling with clarity in prioritizing my goals, confidence in my decisions and actions, and the composure needed to enjoy life’s simple pleasures without stress. Voilà, the 3 C’s—Clarity, Confidence, and Composure—were synthesized, guiding principles for my journey ahead.\n\n\nArrival\nThe flight was uneventful, and the ensuing train trip from the airport to the retreat location was calm. I managed to buy a small notebook, a “trip journal”, to accompany me on my trip and started journaling right away. After settling into my seat on the train, I took some time to fill out the first of three questionnaires for a research project on the effects of psilocybin conducted by the University of Maastricht. Upon arrival at the retreat, my initial feelings of anticipation quickly gave way to unease. The facilitators could not specify the exact psilocybin content in the truffles we were to consume. Although they assured us that 30 grams of fresh truffles was an appropriate dose, their lack of detailed knowledge about the psilocybin content raised my skepticism. Knowing that mushrooms typically contain between 0.5% - 2.0% psilocybin, and that a moderate dose for a first-time user is around 1.5 grams, I was alarmed. A ‘heroic dose’ of 5 grams, as termed by Terence McKenna, seemed daunting. Yet, we were assured that 30 grams of truffles would be fine. Things didn’t add up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerence McKena\n\n\n\nTerence McKenna (1946-2000) was an American ethnobotanist, mystic, psychonaut, lecturer, and author. He is best known for his advocacy of the use of naturally occurring psychedelic substances, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, and ayahuasca. McKenna’s work focused on the potential of these substances to catalyze profound personal and cultural transformation.\nOne of his notable contributions to psychedelic culture is the concept of the “heroic dose” — a high dose of psilocybin mushrooms, typically around 5 grams, taken in a safe and controlled environment. He believed that such a dose could facilitate deep and transformative experiences, allowing individuals to access the far reaches of their consciousness.\n\n\n“I took 30 grams last week plus an MAO inhibitor and it was fine,” was one of the facilitator’s responses to my concerns. Another added, “Don’t worry. You have to think less. You are way too much in your head. Each trip is different. Gender, height, weight, none of it matters because everyone reacts differently.” Another participant, who would later have a panic attack, and I were the only ones who had read up on dosage amounts and expressed concerns. After the retreat, I learned from a Google search that truffles contain between 0.2% and 0.6% psilocybin. The lower potency meant that a larger dosage is required to achieve similar effects as with normal mushrooms. However, without precise information beforehand, I was left to wonder about the potency and safety of what I was about to ingest. This initial uncertainty set a tone of caution and mistrust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are MAO inhibitors?\n\n\n\nMAO inhibitors (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) are a class of drugs that prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their availability. When combined with psilocybin, MAO inhibitors can enhance and prolong the effects by preventing the breakdown of psilocybin into psilocin. This can lead to more intense and longer-lasting trips.\n\n\n\n\nSharing Circle - Catharsis & Bonding\nOnce all participants arrived, we began the first structured activity: a sharing circle. Each participant and the facilitators were invited to share their backgrounds, the challenges they faced, and their hopes for the retreat. This exercise was designed to foster a sense of community and mutual support. As I listened to others’ stories of struggle and hope, I felt a profound sense of connection and empathy. Hearing the raw, honest experiences of others made me realize I was not alone in my journey.\nWhen my turn came, I opened up about my own life’s challenges. The act of sharing was emotionally overwhelming, and I found myself crying as I spoke. The release felt liberating — a moment of catharsis. This was the first glimmer of the healing I hoped to find at the retreat. Additionally, it was empowering to help others by listening to their stories. We built an initial reservoir of trust within the group. The facilitators did an excellent job of helping us open up and providing the space to express ourselves. The healing properties of hearing and being heard were nothing short of miraculous.\n\n\nThe Ceremony - Intention Setting (Part 1)\nWith the sharing session complete, we changed into more comfortable clothes and moved into the ceremony room to set our intentions for the psilocybin journey. We sat in front of an altar of candles, each lighting one for ourselves while thanking Mother Earth and expressing our wishes for the journey with the truffles. As each person took their turn, the room filled with a collective sense of purpose. When my turn came, I lit my candle and voiced my hopes for clarity, confidence, and composure - the 3 C’s.\nOnce we finished, we took our spots on the mattresses that had been prepared for us. In my “trip journal” I wrote down, “Be brave and heal.” This act of intention-setting felt like a ritual, grounding me in the purpose of the journey ahead. I took a last look at the token I brought with me: a Polaroid of my partner and me on Christmas Eve underneath a mistletoe.\nThe facilitators then made their rounds through the room, approaching each bed individually to wish each participant a good journey and hand them the medicine. They served the truffles in a small translucent bowl, accompanied by a twig of a needle tree, a small pot of honey, and a menthol candy. As they approached my bed, I felt the massive weight of my life challenges looming over me, and I cracked under their weight, tears the size of grapes rolling down my cheeks. I reminded myself, “Be brave and heal.”\n\n\nThe Ceremony - The first Challenge (Part 2)\nThe ingestion of the 30 grams of truffles marked the beginning of the journey. These initial stages, before the psilocybin took effect, were characterized by a sense of anticipation and openness. I was ready to embrace whatever insights the experience would bring by consistently asking, “What are you trying to teach me?”. As the psilocybin started to take effect, I felt a mixture of physical sensations — trembling, tingling, and waves of laughter.\nAt first, the trip was positive. However, as the experience deepened, the first challenge emerged. The music, a crucial part of the experience, stopped playing. I took off my eyeshades, curious and concerned about what was happening. Three facilitators were huddling around the sound system, unable to get it to work, disrupting the collective journey with their apparent incompetence.\nAt the same time, the group leader was absent. Someone went to fetch her, and she soon appeared, acknowledging the problem but trying to downplay it. She realized that the situation wasn’t ideal, but that the others are going to figure it out. In the meantime she played some music on a handpan.\nThe soft sound of the handpan, a kind of steel drum, was soothing. I decided to resume my journey, putting my eyeshades back on and trying to relax. I told myself: “Fair enough, humans make mistakes”. For a while, I felt one with the soft, wavy sounds from the drums. Eventually, the facilitators managed to get the music working again, and the ceremony continued smoothly for a time.\n\n\nThe Ceremony - Musical Fallout (Part 3)\nThe music stopped again. Initially, I laughed at the loud sound when the aux cable was removed, but as the silence continued, my irritation grew. This technical glitch, combined with the facilitators’ visible inability to fix it promptly, shattered my sense of safety and trust. Paranoia set in as I thought, “Why don’t these people know what they are doing? They don’t know how to ‘hold space.’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding Space\n\n\n\nI’m referring here to the common jargon in psychedelic and other healing practices. Holding space is basically the facilitator’s or shaman’s responsibility while somebody is on a trip, to give them the room necessary, an emotional room, to express anything that they’re feeling, and not to judge them.\n\n\nI lifted my eyeshade and saw participants in distress — some vomiting, others panicking or crying heavily. What had previously seemed amusing now felt deeply concerning. The atmosphere grew tense, and my distrust intensified. The facilitators were roaming around, looking suspiciously at each other and at me, reflecting my growing paranoia. My heart pounded in my chest, each thump echoing the growing sense of dread as I watched the facilitators fumble with the equipment. I began to suspect something was very wrong. “These people don’t know what they’re doing, or worse, they tricked us,” I thought. My mind raced with thoughts of being drugged and the unprofessionalism of the facilitators. “Why did I trust them? They said it would be fine, but this is a nightmare.”\nI wrote in my journal:\n\nHow do I know if anything is real? I don’t understand any of this. I should be in nature not in here. Am I having a bad trip?\n\nA tall, muscular, tattooed facilitator, whom I’ll call “Big G,” noticed my distress and tried to calm me. His limited English made it difficult to communicate effectively. His presence wasn’t enough to keep me calm. I looked into his eyes, searching for reassurance. “How can I trust you if we don’t speak the same language?” I uttered in defiance. Somehow, Big G managed to calm me and convince me to “trust and let go”. I assured myself that it’s going to be fine and that I shouldn’t worry. I thought, “Okay, I’m here to trust, be brave and heal.”\n\n\nThe Ceremony - Detergent Drama (Part 4)\nAnd so I lay down, put on my eyeshade again, and eventually, they got the music playing. But the melodies that filled the room were not what I expected. This one had voices and sounded like underground techno. It felt very odd, increasing my feelings of suspicion and paranoia. I didn’t like this at all. At this point, the whole story might sound like a bad trip, but I was convinced I was fine. I was still capable of handling it. The experience wasn’t pleasant, but it wasn’t scary either. I reminded myself to ask: “What are you trying to teach me?” A few moments later, one of the caregivers moved around me to flavor the air. That’s expected, but the way she did it was really weird. When I still didn’t have my eyeshades on me a few moments earlier, I saw her cleaning the bookshelf with some sort of detergent.\nShe held a paper towel in the air and sprayed the detergent on it. Then she smelled the tissue, looked at her co-workers with a funny, slightly disgusted look, shrugged, and used the towel to clean the shelf.\nTo me, this looked absurd. Moments later, she was walking around with the same paper towel, moving it back and forth to spread the scent. It was really bizarre. I was expecting the facilitators to walk around with scented candles or burnt herbs and spices, not cleaning detergent that they themselves thought smelled weird. Again, I was like, “What’s going on here?”\nAs these ridiculous thoughts roamed my mind I took off my eyeshades and asked the woman with the scented tissue, “What are you doing? You seem like you have no clue what you’re doing.” She just smiled and shrugged.\nThe evidence of the staff’s incompetence started piling up. It seemed almost like a circus. It felt like they had just read about these journeys and started offering them without being truly inspired or informed by meaningful research.\nAnother indication was that not everyone had eyeshades. This is supposed to be one of the most important things besides headphones. Yet, they didn’t offer any headphones either and played music from a large sound system for the entire room. At that point, I just thought, “This is weird, this is odd, I’m not feeling it, I think I’m stuck here. That’s bad.” I tried to gauge how bad the situation was by seeing how much control I could exert over my tripping mind and body. “Okay, I have some willpower, I can do stuff, I can talk, I can move. This actually is not too bad. I’m quite present. I’m awake, not drunk. I can move my limbs. Yes, I can’t formulate super tight and bulletproof thoughts, but I know something’s wrong here, and I think I should speak up.”\n\n\nThe Ceremony - “I Have a Voice” (Part 5)\nI looked around and saw that everyone was having a bad time. The scene felt like something out of a nightmare, the kind you hear about later in documentaries. “This is how we escaped this drama and nightmare of a psilocybin trip,” I thought. Realizing that someone needed to speak up, I decided it had to be me. “I have a voice,” I started saying, breaking the strict silence of the ceremony. Big G approached, his expression puzzled. “Wow, what the hell are you doing, man?” he asked. Instead of “holding space” and helping me understand the situation, he tried to push me back onto my mattress. I pulled away, feeling my anger rise. “Whoa, don’t touch me. You said you wouldn’t touch us during the ceremony. You’re breaking your own rules. Do you even know what you’re doing?” Feeling justified, I continued, “I have a voice, let me speak.” Big G insisted I remain silent, but I retorted, “Of course I can.” Paranoia surged through me. Were they plotting against us? Did they want to steal our belongings while we were drugged? I demanded to see my stuff. Unable to handle my insistence, Big G called over another facilitator, an older man whose eyes seemed more trustworthy. He tried to calm me, saying I couldn’t speak or see my belongings. “Why not?” I challenged. His vague explanation about the ceremony wasn’t convincing. “You’re not explaining it well. Why can’t I see my stuff?” After multiple requests and watching him go back and forth to consult the ceremony master, who was conspicuously absent, he finally conceded. “You can see your things,” he said, and I felt a small victory amidst the chaos.\n\n\nThe Ceremony - The Nutella White Bread Witch (Part 6)\nSo I left the ceremony room and entered the kitchen, which was the next room over. The ceremony leader was there, and when she saw me, she said, “Oh, you want to see your belongings? Really? Go ahead, You’re making a fool of yourself.”\nI was shocked. Just moments prior, maybe an hour and a half ago, I had been pouring out my heart to these people, sharing my story, explaining everything that had happened to me, where I was in life, and the problems I was facing. I cried and had this cathartic moment where sharing all of this felt wonderful.\nAnd now, here we were, and she hits me right in the face with this attitude change? She dropped her “let’s heal together” mask to replace it with a nutella-whitebread-eating “you are just business for me” mask.\nThe ceremony master, who was supposed to be the person I trusted most, the one who would help me through this experience and hold space for me, was suddenly dismissive. To me, she looked like the Nutella White Bread Witch.\nIt made me realize what it truly means to hold space — to give me permission to express any weird thoughts, to cry, laugh, seek nature, love, or feel anxious, stressed, and paranoid.\nThese people were supposed to help me through this rollercoaster, reassuring me, saying, “Hey, we’ve got you covered. It’s fine. That’s totally normal, Kay. How can we assist you? You want to see your things? That’s okay. Of course, you can see your things. Would you feel better if your stuff was next to you in the ceremony room?”\nBut no, the ceremony master was very blunt. I called her out, “Wow, you changed 180 degrees. Why are you so stone-faced right now and so direct?” She replied, “Yes, I am direct. You can’t expect us to be there with you all the time.” To which I replied, “You should be in there with us, helping us with this experience, and yet here you are eating a Nutella White Bread sandwich in a place where you’re selling us healing, nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle. What the actual fuck are you doing?”\nI was mad and baffled. So I went to get my backpack and came back to the kitchen. She said, “Yeah, go ahead, check your stuff. You’re making a fool of yourself. Look at you.” She made me feel like I was this pathetic person ruining everybody’s experience because I couldn’t keep it to myself.\n\n\nThe Ceremony - It’s all about Decisions (Part 7)\nI looked at my stuff and did feel pathetic. I saw my broken water bottle, the scraps, and the worn-out backpack and a black v-neck shirt I didn’t really like. Inside, there was a wet swimsuit because I had gone for a swim the day before the retreat and hadn’t dried it. I thought, “Wow, this is my life, and it’s kind of pathetic.” I looked at her and all this and thought about my decisions.\nPanicked, I confronted them with the fact that they made me take 30 grams of truffles to which they responded that I did it myself. They started repeating that I signed a contract, which was totally misplaced. So much for, “holding space”. It didn’t take me long before I agreed, it was my decision. A bad one.\nIt dawned on me that I had made the wrong decisions. A year ago, I was with the brightest and smartest people on Earth, working on the most important issue of our time - AI Safety. And a year later, I had managed to mess up so massively that I was now stuck in a dirty kitchen in the Netherlands, drugged and about to be robbed.\nI was still convinced that I could die there or be stuck forever because they had drugged us and would steal all our stuff, and I wouldn’t get away. I thought, “Wow, I seriously made the wrong decisions here.”\nAnd then, suddenly, I lost touch with reality, not just somewhat, but a lot.\n\n\nThe Ceremony - What is reality? (Part 8)\nA thought hit me, “Well, what is real and what isn’t? Am I real?” I wanted to see my body, so I took off my pants. I mustered my slim stilts, “Do I have legs? What are legs anyway?” And I started touching my legs. “Okay, those seem real.” I spoke to the retreat facilitators while doing this, and they were horrified.\nThey exclaimed, “Oh my God, what are you doing, Kay? Why are you taking off your pants? You’re making a fool of yourself. You can’t do this here.” They didn’t believe that I was genuinely exploring these insights. They said, “We don’t buy it, you’re being rude, Kay!” while I was genuinely questioning the fabric of time and spce. “Oh, wow. Okay. Reality. What is that all about?”\nI felt like the moment was infinite, and I was part of this loop where nothing mattered, but not in a bad way—more like an optimistically nihilistic way. I thought, “Oh my gosh, I could die. But really, nothing does matter, right? It’s all about decisions, and anything can happen, and that’s sort of nice. It gives us a lot of freedom, but ultimately it doesn’t matter.”\n\n\nThe Ceremony - Love and Actions (Part 8)\nAs my thoughts continued to materialize, I captured a few of them. My journal reads:\n\nThe importance of fearlessness! Be specific. Accept beauty. I want to remember. I want to embrace love. Give me a language for love. Everything has a price. Trust and let go? Many more questions than answers. What are rules? Why am I not supposed to talk? Decisions seem to be everything. I can shape everything. I am ACTION MAN! This is too hectic.\n\nDespite the paranoia, there were moments of profound insight. I grappled with existential questions and the nature of reality. I felt a strong urge to connect with nature, understand the concept of fearlessness, and embrace love.\nMy journal offers a few more of the things that I truly felt:\n\nThat I like language. I like structure. I want to love my partner. I feel like a failure. My experience should have looked different. I love being sober. Who I spend my time with will determine the quality of my life. I hate rules. I hate people who are incompetent or inactive. Hate is such a strong word. I want to love instead.\n\nI told two of the other facilitators, about a few things that I realized, and honestly, deeply felt. And they told me, in a, what I perceived to be sarcastic, undertone: “Oh wow, how deep, that’s a great insight. Go back to the ceremony room, and have some more insights. Go have a journey, you will see. You’ll have a journey, it’ll be great.” By the time we were done, “Go have a journey!” felt like the most hollow platitude on earth.\nTheir remarks left me rather irritated, but at one point, I felt a surge of love and thought, “Oh, wow, that’s the answer. That’s important.” I felt ready to go back to the ceremony room again and exclaimed: “If you can open up and show me love, then I will go back to the room and enjoy the experience.”\nSo I wanted a hug, but when I looked at the facilitators, they were skeptical, saying, “We don’t buy this, Kay.” I responded, “Wow, this is so sad. It’s all about love; you’re supposed to share love with me, but you’re being mean.”\nEventually Big G gave in and offered me a hug, but his face seemed fake and hostile. I tried to analyze his mimicry and tried to grasp his intentions. Upon closer inspection, I couldn’t see any genuineness on his face. I would have gotten back to my bed if I did see a genuine smile but I felt like they trapped me in this goddamn house, trying to rob me of the life I still had ahead of me.\nAt that point, I thought, “Okay, I shouldn’t be here.” Big G took me by the arm and was a bit forceful, trying to drag me to another room. I told him to stop, saying, “You’re out of your bounds here, and you’re not supposed to do that. If you’re unable to share love, I will call my partner, Julita.”\nThey told me that I couldn’t call anybody which only fuled my defiance, “You can’t tell me what to do. I need to make the rules. I will and I can.”\nThey tried to prevent me from calling Julita, but at that moment, I was focused on love. I wanted to spread and share it. The most important person in my life was not there to hear how much I loved her and how dearly I held her in my heart. I insisted that they let me experience and express this.\n\n\nThe Ceremony - A Very Long Conversation (Part 9)\nEventually, I did call her. We ended up having a very long conversation, or how she later recalled “a phone call in which I mostly made weird comments, intersperesed with long moments of silence and her resorting to observing my behavior and the surroundings, trying to keep it cool while she was afraid for my life . She stayed on the phone with me for about two hours. During this time, I obviously behaved rather oddly. I had long moments of just staring at the ceiling with my mouth open, having some sort of insight, and then not making much sense while talking.\nTo a large extent, I had lost touch with what was real. I didn’t know what reality was anymore. I didn’t know what it meant to be a dad. I was questioning whether anyone could truly be a dad. I thought, “If I’m not with Julita, she won’t give birth to anyone because only the things I participate in actually come to fruition.”\nThen, I noticed a car outside and thought, “It must be the greatest experience on earth to drive a car. Has anybody ever driven a car?” I was fascinated, thinking, “That’s what they’re selling us in these music videos, right? But they put up all these barriers, like needing a permit to drive. Who has any of this? Do I have a permit? I don’t think so. I would love to drive a car. There’s a car outside—I could just decide to go out and drive it, right?”\nMy thoughts continued to spiral. “Flying,” I thought, “Flying must be amazing.”\nI tried to reach out to Julita through my phone and materialize on her side of reality. Needless to say, it didn’t work.\nStill in the kitchen, I finally asked for some water, drank it, and found it refreshing. But then I just wanted to be outside. It was so beautiful—the sky was nice, the sun was shining. Yet, I was tucked away in a room, which didn’t feel right. It seemed obvious to me that I should be outside now.\nThe whole building complex was in an industrial setting with small mechanic shops around, not at all like a nice retreat center with plenty of nature, water, and trees like other locations. I just wanted to go out, enjoy a fresh breath of air, and feel healthy.\nAfter making my desires known to the facilitators they told me, “No, you can’t go out. We’re here for your safety.” At that point, I thought, “What do you know about safety? Clearly, you don’t know anything.” This frustration lasted for a while, but when I finally did get outside, it was beautiful.\n\n\nPost Ceremony - The Afterglow (Part 1)\nAs the effects of the psilocybin began to wane, the facilitators finally allowed me to go outside. I was still on the phone with Julita, which unsettled the other participants who were also outside. One of the facilitators asked me to end the conversation. I did so reluctantly, believing the participants could and should speak for themselves. It seemed like they were silenced by the facilitators. Eventually, I asked them directly if they wanted me to stop talking. They implied that they did. Everyone received hot soup, a bowl full of fruit, and there was plenty of white bread and cheap, industrially manufactured dips from ALDI on the table. As I tried to process the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts from the trip, I experienced a mix of emotions. I felt both very close to the other people around me, intrigued by their uniqueness and the energy they radiated, and alienated from the group at large. A part of me still believed that we had been drugged and that everyone knew it, but no one seemed to talk about it.\nI initiated a few conversations that went nowhere as the other participants kept their distance. Some of them started talking to one another in Dutch, enjoying a good conversation, but it left me feeling excluded and left to my own devices.\nAs I took the time to “just be,” everything seemed to glitter in the new light. The first breath of air I took felt sumptuous, full, and revitalizing. It was exactly what I needed. Everything was still moving; wonderful shapes kept forming in the leaves, and the world around me was morphing, alive, and breathing. I noticed a bike hidden in the leaf-covered fence and thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. The bike, an integral part of Dutch culture, struck me as significant. Here I was in the Netherlands, a country that allows people to legally experience different states of mind. Suddenly, culture seemed of immense importance, and I felt culturally foreign for the first time in my life—a feeling exacerbated by the proximity of the Netherlands to Germany, where I was born. Coming to terms with what I had just experienced I started to realize that the key driver of my behavior was my ego. Initially, I thought I was simply unable to trust and let go, but I soon realized that I usually extend total trust upfront. The issue is that once lost, it’s hard for people to regain it due to my high standards and requirement for competence, especially from those who haven’t gained my trust by means of being a long-term acquaintance.\n\n\n\nPost Ceremony - The Rejected Apology (Part 2)\nAs I continued to feel alienated, I decided to seek out my mattress. A while later, the ceremony master appeared in the room. Gathering my courage, I asked her for a word. I sought to apologize for my disruptive behavior during the ceremony, hoping to reconcile and understand her perspective. To my surprise, she dismissed me curtly, saying, “Wait until tomorrow.” Her tone was cold, and she barely looked at me. This rejection deepened my feelings of isolation and remorse, making me feel even more adrift. As I lay back on my mattress, I reflected on why I felt the need to apologize. I realized I had experienced a profound loss of reality during the ceremony. I didn’t trust my own paranoia and my own experience. Even after the effects wore off and I was sober again, part of me wondered if my suspicions had been unwarranted. Had I hallucinated aspects of the facilitators behavior? I began to see the facilitators as potentially genuine, which made me feel ashamed for not mustering the courage to trust them during the ceremony. I thought about how my actions might have caused distress to them and the other participants. The memory of the chaos I had caused played on a loop in my mind, making me cringe with regret. I felt a deep sense of sorrow for the trouble I had caused, wishing I could turn back time and handle things differently. I had been brutally honest with my criticism, telling them they didn’t speak proper English and questioning their competence. Who was I to tell them how to do their job? I wanted to apologize for not extending them the trust that others had managed to do. I realized I had robbed myself of much of the experience by my lack of trust and paranoia, but more importantly, I had caused distress to others.\nI wanted to make amends and hear their perspective now that I was sober. However, I was blocked from this reconciliation. At that point, I wasn’t sure if my perception of their hostility was accurate or if I had been overly sensitive and overreacted.\nTo my surprise, Julita had recorded part of our conversation during the ceremony. A few days later, she asked me, “Why were these people so mean to you?” Her question confirmed that it wasn’t just my impression. She described their language as abrasive, even abusive, and their demeanor as nasty. Without a direct opportunity to apologize and gain more insight into others’ perspectives on the situation, I went to bed with unresolved feelings of guilt and confusion."

    "section": "Day 2",
    "text": "Day 2\nA new day began, promising its own set of challenges, some of which I was still unaware of. As I woke up, I wrote the following:\n\nA new day has started, and I am the same person. I am ultimately responsible for my life. The decisions I make carry impact. Language is important, and I should think more before I speak. I want to use positive language that invites people to share more of themselves with me. I want to invite humor, laughter, love, and trust. Is my ego too strong? I think this trip showed me that I am too afraid to let go, surrender, and trust. My inner child was trembling. As the mushrooms started acting, I felt an earthquake in my jaw. It was shaking, in awe of the experience I was expecting.\n\nReflecting on these thoughts, I continued to write about what I think I should change next time:\n\nTrust my facilitators more. Use headphones instead of blasting music through speakers. Know the correct dosage. Work with people who are knowledgeable of the science. And get more competent facilitators. Tell people that you don’t like authority and that you need reassurance. Get more personal care.\n\nAs I penned these reflections, I felt a mixture of hope and determination. The earthquake in my jaw had been a physical manifestation of my inner turmoil, a sign of the deep-seated fear and anticipation that had gripped me. Now, with the clarity of a new day, I was ready to embrace these lessons and move forward.\n\nSharing Circle - Shame and Alienation\nAfter a short breakfast, we came together to share our experiences. We gathered in the same room where, a day ago, we had all come together as partly broken people. What did we learn? Who did we become? As part of the ritual, there was a big scepter, and the person holding the scepter was in charge of speaking, invited to share as long as they wanted, as long as they held the scepter. For me, this session was internally titled “Shame & Reconciliation.” I still felt a deep sense of shame for my behavior during the trip—using my phone, breaking the rules, and potentially disrupting others’ experiences. I was desperate for reconciliation.\nAs others spoke, I jotted down notes in my journal, wrestling with my thoughts:\n\nI value truth over conformity. What does respect mean to me? “Me” in underscore. I need to be very careful who I let help me interpret the world. I want to interpret the world myself.\n\nThese reflections stemmed from my belief that the facilitators lacked the competence to guide me through my experience. I needed to trust that they had more knowledge and experience than I did, which wasn’t the case. When my turn came, a profound sense of shame and alienation washed over me. While some participants spoke of transformative journeys, I was fixated on the facilitators’ accusations and my own perceived failures. The sense of community felt fractured. It was heartening to see three participants regain a youthful, hopeful spirit, but for many of us, the trip had been hard and unfulfilling.\nReluctantly, after an eternal silence inspecting the scepter, I began to speak. I wanted to apologize, even considering an anonymized headcount to see who felt disturbed by my actions, but the ceremony master rejected this idea. Gathering my courage, I took 3 seconds to look each person in the eye and offered a sincere apology, though not everyone met my gaze.\nTo close off the session, the ceremony master had told the group that we were very impressionable in the upcoming days because of the psilocybin. She advised us to avoid large groups, news, and anything stressful, recommending we relax and maybe go for a walk in nature. Yet, shortly after this, she would disregard her own advice and insinuate that there might be something seriously wrong with me.\n\n\nA Final Word - The Accusation:\nAfter the sharing session, I approached the ceremony master, and she invited me to a private conversation. I assumed I would be able to apologize and ask her what she thought went wrong. But she began by asking if she could be honest with me. I told her she could be brutally honest, valuing constructive feedback. What ensued, however, was an accusation, much more than feedback. Her words were a harsh blow, delivered without the empathy or professionalism I had expected from a retreat leader. This accusation left me questioning not just my behavior during the trip but my overall character and worth—something I wasn’t expecting to have to deal with.\nShe started by saying that I was beyond narcissistic and that I might have psychopathic tendencies, adding that my life was “so fucked up.” If you’re wondering whether she used these exact words, yes, she did. She suggested I seek psychological help for the sake of my future child. This behavior was unacceptable from a group leader.\n\n“You’re a Psychopath, Where Were Your Insights? You Owe Your Child. Your Life is So Fucked Up.”\n\nI was in shock. After advising us to avoid negative stimuli because we were impressionable, she gave me this “bad news.” Yes, she asked for permission to share her thoughts honestly, and I told her to be brutally honest. But a brutally honest opinion doesn’t signify truth and is most definitely not helpful in the aftermath of a psilocybin experience. She could have waited to share her thoughts a week later when everything was settled, but she did not.\nShe and another facilitator she summoned for the conversation tried to reassure me that it was for my best and that they told me this because they cared for me, not because they hated me. Hated? I was baffled that they would even use this word. It seemed like they were trying to deceive themselves along with me. She tried to soften the blow by saying that she wasn’t a psychiatrist and that her opinion was not a diagnosis. Yet she promptly followed up by saying she had worked with many criminals with worse illnesses than mine, confirming that she indeed thought I had psychopathic tendencies and was “ill.” To put this into context, she had told the group on the first day that she had been a criminal psychiatrist working with outlaws for more than 20 years. That sure seemed contradictory.\nThe two of them tried to muster empathy for me, telling me it must be hard to contain myself in normal life and hide my true face. They were convinced that I used people for my advantage and loved to cross their boundaries. Then, they invited me to share what I thought and asked about any insights I had during the trip because they wanted it to be a safe space.\nI shared that I appreciated their feedback but that it all came back to some thoughts I had during and after the trip: “Who helps me make sense of reality? Who helps me interpret reality? Most people defer to some sort of experts. Here, we were supposed to defer to them because they’ve led these ceremonies before. But I want to interpret my reality myself because I don’t trust their expertise and skill level.” From all I’ve seen, clearly, they have read even less than I have on the topic. And I’ve only read a book and a half. This was insufficient. They were operating at a very low-quality level. Their reaction was less favorable than their invitation to share my thoughts would have me believe. They told me, “Yeah, well, those are thoughts, not insights. You didn’t have any insights.” I told them, “Well, here’s an insight: everyone is selling something and you’re not selling it very well.” They replied, “Well, I’m not selling anything.” I didn’t respond, but I thought, “Yes, you are. You’re selling healing, emotional relief, one of the most important experiences of a lifetime, and healthy living, and you’re not doing it well.” A picture of the Nutella White Bread Witch burnt itself into my memory. I left the conversation questioning myself and convinced that what I had experienced was unprofessional. They saw a tiny glimpse of my behavior, influenced by 30 grams of truffles and an unpleasant environment, and they had the audacity to make a judgment about my character the size of Mount Everest.\nThat was it, I was determined to write about my experience."

    "text": "Day 2-5: Family, Sports, and Journaling\nAs my last conversation came to an end, I started packing my belongings and waited outside to be picked up by my father. He was my first point of contact after the retreat and helped me put things into perspective, especially the final accusation. He reassured me that I am empathetic and not a psychopath.\nI spent the upcoming days with family and friends, sharing my experiences. However, the depth of my turmoil was difficult to convey. For the most part I was unaware of it myself. Despite this, their support was unwavering. Amidst the chaos, there were moments of joy when I shared the news of the pregnancys.\nEngaging in physical activities like swimming, biking, and running grounded me and provided a sense of normalcy. I journaled extensively, trying to make sense of the experience and its aftermath. Writing allowed me to process my thoughts and emotions, but it also reminded me of the unresolved questions. This part was crucial because the integration phase after a retreat is just as important, if not more so, than the preparation and actual ceremonhy.\nUnfortunately, my environment didn’t have all healthy influences. During these few days, I had a couple of unhealthy meals—pizza, ice cream, etc. In hindsight, I realized that I could have benefitted from more rest and solitude. People around me watching TV and engaging in other distractions prevented me from fully relaxing and processing the experience. I should have spent more time alone or with someone who understood my need for space and introspection. Being constantly surrounded by people, even those who cared for me, sometimes felt overwhelming and counterproductive."

    "text": "Days 6-12: Post-Ceremony Reflections\nReturning home marked the end of the retreat but not the end of its impact. The journey back to Krakow presented another challenge: seeking reconciliation with my partner. The two hours we spent on the phone during the retreat were very stressful for her. She felt powerless and overwhelmed when I called her in an altered state of mind and shared that I didn’t feel welcome where I was. Our first conversation after I returned was tense. Julita’s voice wavered as she expressed her feelings of helplessness and fear. I could see the toll it had taken on her. “I didn’t know what to do,” she admitted, her eyes filled with concern. “You sounded so lost and scared.” Discussing the retreat with my coach, Adam, was a structured and therapeutic process. He helped me break down the experience into manageable parts, reflecting on both the challenges and the insights. His professional approach provided a safe space to explore my emotions and develop strategies for future journeys. He knew how to hold space. His questions and reflections helped me articulate my thoughts more clearly and identify actionable steps for healing and growth. Together, we dissected each moment of the retreat, from the initial anticipation to the final confrontation. Adam’s insights were invaluable, helping me see patterns in my behavior and understand the deeper fears driving my actions. Ultimately, this led to the creation of this report. By breaking down my experience and reflecting on it in a structured way, I was able to find clarity and direction. Adam’s guidance illuminated the path forward, turning a chaotic and painful experience into a source of learning and growth.\n\nWhat Would I Change?\nFirst and foremost, I would ensure that the person leading the ceremony is someone I trust deeply. They should be more informed about the substance than I am. This entails having extensive knowledge, having read the latest research, and knowing exact dosages and correct norms as proposed by world-class experts like Prof. David Nutt, Prof. Carhart-Harris, or Prof. Griffiths, as well as legendary figures such as Stanislav Grof, James Fadiman, Paul Stamets, Alexander Shulgin, and Albert Hofmann. Additionally, the guide should possess a deep understanding of the cultural and historical context in which the experience is embedded. Competency is key; through competency, I can bypass some of the trust-building that would otherwise require more meetings and personal contact. I imagine how different my experience would have been with a knowledgeable guide. Picture a facilitator who, instead of dismissing my concerns, explains the precise psilocybin content and reassures me with data from recent studies. Their confidence and expertise would ease my anxiety, allowing me to fully immerse in the journey without the cloud of doubt and mistrust. However, in addition to competency, I need more one-on-one sessions with the people facilitating the retreat. Both prior to the session and afterward, I need to be reassured that the integration and preparation are thorough. The gold standard that I found for this is offered by Beckley Retreats as a 13-week program that includes a month of preparation, a five-day ceremony, and several weeks of integration afterward. With such a program, I envision multiple pre-retreat meetings where I could voice my fears and expectations, building a rapport with the facilitators. Post-retreat, these one-on-one sessions would help me process the experience, ensuring that the insights gained are deeply integrated into my daily life. This level of preparation and follow-up would transform the retreat from a disjointed experience into a coherent journey of healing and growth. ### Reflections and Lessons Learned\nSet and Setting: The importance of a proper mindset and environment for a psilocybin experience cannot be overstated. I acknowledge that I lost focus and deviated from my intended mindset during the retreat, which contributed to the negative outcome.\nImprovements for Future Experiences: I plan to bring better eye shades and use headphones to ensure a consistent and personal music experience. Knowing the exact dosage of psilocybin is crucial, and having a checklist to ensure everything is properly prepared will be essential.\nCommunication and Trust: For future trips, I intend to communicate my concerns clearly and ensure that facilitators address them adequately. I recognize the need for more one-on-one sessions with facilitators before and after the ceremony to build trust and ensure proper integration.\nSelf-Trust and Preparedness: Creating a written guide or checklist for myself to follow during the trip can help manage the experience if things go wrong. This includes reassuring myself about reality and reminding myself to trust my own judgment.\nEmpathy and Normalcy: Conversations with friends and family are as important as conversations with properly trained professionals after an experience like this.\nFuture Intentions: I plan to use my next psilocybin journey to heal from the first experience and work through any potentially unresolved traumas. On a positive note, I feel more confident in my ability to handle altered states of mind."

    "text": "Bare Bones Strategy - A Triad\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine you’re navigating a dense forest, seeking a path to safety. You need a map (diagnosis), a clear route to follow (implementation policy), and a guide to lead you step by step (action plan). At its core, a strategy is just like that – a triad of essential elements that guide you through any complex situation.\nA couple comes to Eric’s office. As a therapist it’s his job to sit them down and talk. They express their frustration with the current situation: too little sex, bad financial decisions, distrust, constant bickering, and pesky in-laws. Through the cloud of annoyance, frustration, anger, grief, and resentfulness, Eric identifies a common pattern: the husband spends more time with his friends than his wife because they don’t have common interests in past-time activities. Eric probes the couple with questions to arrive at this problem diagnosis.\nThe obvious next question is: “What can the couple do to fix this issue?” Here are a number of examples of implementation policies:\n\nTry one new hobby each week until they find something both of them like, then double down. (Explore & Exploit)\nIntegrate the wife into at least one activity per week that the husband does with his friends. (Social Integration)\nMake the wife commit to doing one activity the husband likes for at least one month, once a week, in the hope that she’ll acquire useful skills that make her enjoy the activities more. (Passion through Skill Building)\n\nThe couple likes option 3. A good plan, however, is useless without putting it into action. So they administer an action plan:\n\nAgree on an activity (e.g., play snooker together).\nSet a recurring meeting that works with both schedules (e.g., Monday 19:00-21:00).\nShow up and receive rewards (e.g., have their favorite meal after the snooker game).\n\nThere we go. At its bare minimum, a strategy is this: a diagnosis, an implementation policy, and an action plan."

How do you react?\nChange it: Identify the problem, devise a solution, and act on it. Reassigning or reprioritizing tasks can help ease your burden.\nAvoid it: Handing in your resignation is an option. It offers instant relief but might come at the cost of long-term distress.\nAccept it: This is perhaps the trickiest. Seeing the situation for what it is and “being at ease” is hard. Nobody likes to be buried in work, yet some tasks need to be done.\nI think the Serenity Prayer summarizes it best:\n\nO God, give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be changed, and the wisdom to know the one from the other.\n\nFunnily, it doesn’t include avoidance.

    "text": "Control - Watch out, it might be a trap\n\n\n\n\n\nTim, an inexperienced software developer, dreams of launching his own tech startup. He boldly breaks free from his corporate chains and dives headfirst into entrepreneurship. His excitement quickly turns to despair as he realizes he lacks the business savvy, professional network, management experience, and financial stability to succeed. Humbled, Tim returns to the corporate grind with the intent to diligently build his skills. When he finally feels ready to leave again, he faces significant resistance: his employer fights to keep him, and his peers advise caution. Having control over your career, while desirable, can sometimes be a double-edged sword. Seeking out control can come with two significant traps. Let’s look at each in turn.\n\n1. The Low Career Capital Trap\nCareer capital refers to the relevant and rare skills & resources you accumulate over time. It’s the currency that buys you freedom in your professional journey. If you seek control over your work without sufficient career capital, you might quit your job only to find your options limited and your ability to pursue them inadequate. Avoid this trap by building ample career capital first.\nWhen Tim first tried to leave, his career capital was insufficient to sustain the degree of control he desired. He was wise to return and build more capital before planning his second exit.\n\n\n2. The Resistance Trap\nWhen Tim finally felt ready to leave again after building his career capital, he encountered significant resistance. His employer, recognizing his value, fought hard to retain him with offers of promotion and incentives. Meanwhile, his peers urged him to stay on the conventional path, warning him of the risks of entrepreneurship and reminding him of the sweet taste of a regular income. This resistance, while frustrating, was a clear sign that Tim had amassed enough career capital to pursue and exercise control over his professional path confidently.\n\n\n3. The Remedy: Financial Viability\nEven if you overcome these two traps, maintaining control over your work can still be challenging. Financial viability often determines whether you can continue to control your work. To that end, follow this maxim: “Do what others are willing to pay for.”\nTim learned the hard way that financial viability is crucial. His first venture failed due to a lack of financial planning and sustainable revenue. Determined to avoid repeating his mistakes, Tim meticulously planned his new startup, ensuring it offered services clients were eager to pay for. By prioritizing financial sustainability, Tim was able to secure the control he desired over his career and continue his entrepreneurial journey with confidence.\nAvoid the two traps that hinder your quest for control. Ensure your projects are financially viable to sustain them. Remember, control is a powerful tool—wield it wisely and with foresight."

    "text": "(In)effective ways to apologize\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of an apology? We typically apologize when our actions negatively impact someone else and we regret those actions. Apologies aim to make amends and repair relationships.\nLet’s examine a few typical (but ineffective) ways in which apologies are delivered:\n\n1. “Sorry, but”\n\n“I’m so sorry for being late, but I missed the bus.”\n\nThe “Sorry, but” apology is well-intentioned, but it shifts the blame away from the speaker. By saying “I missed the bus,” they avoid taking full responsibility for being late.\n\n\n2. “Sorry”\n\n“I’m so sorry for being late.”\n\nThis version is better because it doesn’t shift the blame, but it still lacks an acceptance of responsibility.\nTo remedy this we’ll look at a few atypical (but effective) ways in which apologies are delivered:\n\n\n3. “Sorry, I will”\n\n“I’m so sorry for being late. Next time, I’ll leave the house on time.”\n\nThis version includes a concrete plan to avoid repeating the mistake, demonstrating that you have reflected on your actions and are committed to change. You’re taking responsibility for your actions.\n\n\n4. “Sorry, I will, and thank you”\n\n“I’m so sorry for being late. Next time, I’ll leave the house on time. Thank you for being so patient with me.”\n\nAdding a “thank you” to your apology acknowledges the other person’s demonstration of character and elevates their status. This approach not only makes it more likely they will accept your apology but also encourages them to embody the virtue you’ve recognized.\nQuick tip: Above all, be sincere and honest in your apology. Don’t say things you don’t believe. An inauthentic apology is worse than no apology.\nThere are different levels of apology. Reflect on past apologies you’ve given and received, and plan your next apology for maximum impact. By doing so, you can ensure your apologies are sincere, effective, and relationship-enhancing."

    "text": "Smelly Vagabounds(,) and Thinkers\n\nI highly recommended listening Epic Mountain while reading this piece.\n\nIt all started last year when I began reading “The master algorithm” by Pedro Domingos. The smell of sweaty hungover travelers was thickening the air in the Columbian 10-bed dorm I found shelter in. Although I would later find out how little I actually understood, a profound feeling of understanding the complex world we have to navigate, creeped up my sleeve as I kept on reading about artificial intelligence, algorithms, and philosophy. Wait a moment - philosophy? Yeah, philosophy. Many brilliant thoughts that Domingos writes about started out their journey in the head of a thinker’s curiosity-driven pursuit of knowledge - ergo philosophy. As you might guess the epiphanic feeling of understanding “what the heck was going on in the world of tech” didn’t last long. Soon enough I was not only surrounded by smelly vagabonds but also by heavily complex thoughts ranging from philosophy to computer science and back to the world of mathematics. A little lost and confused I decided to put down the book and get to grips with the basics first. That’s when I decided to devote the majority of my time reading and studying philosophy. The next image is a depiction of me. Literally, go ask my friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward, December 2019. Over the last couple of months, I devoted a good chunk of my time pondering philosophical questions, when I got curious again. Now that I had at least a basic understanding of philosophy, I remembered that there was something else that bugged my mind. Algorithms, Programming and Mathematics. I should start getting technical right? - Yep. And so I did. Well, at least I tried. Getting into programming and refreshing some of my mathematical knowledge wasn’t as easy as previously thought.\nWeeks later, near the end of February 2020, I finally managed to pull through the strenuous task of finishing my first online Machine Learning Course. Did I enjoy it? Well… It was tough, and I was nowhere near to programming my first line in Python, which by now I knew was the go-to programming language for Machine Learning. But then again, did I even try learning to write any Python code? Mhm, let’s skip that part. Being the problem solver that I am I tried to find a better, more satisfying way to get into AI. I was determined to learn. Hell, so determined that I walked around my new hometown Madrid for 3 weeks on end to talk to people who’d already been navigating the complex world of machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. After several failed attempts to find a suitable environment to learn, I got lucky. The Immune Coding Institute offered a Data Science Bootcamp, and I was accepted to partake! I jumped on that chance and grabbed it by the balls.\n“Finally, every day I’ll be surrounded by like-minded people with whom I’ll share a common goal: Becoming a Data Scientist.” - At least that’s what I thought. Invigorated, enthusiastic and full of joy I completed the first two sessions of the Bootcamp only to wake up the next day to realize that the Corona Crisis had reached Madrid. Another setback to my efforts of becoming a Data Scientist? No, not this time!\n\n\nRegnosis: The Corona Crisis, a blessing in disguise?\nLike many of you out there, I am trapped at home, prohibited from going out. It’s shit, right? Well, actually, no! Why’s that, you might ask. Here’s the thing, let’s make a thought experiment, good ol’ philosopher-style. In hindsight, what will you think of today’s situation 6 months from now? Go ahead, take a couple of minutes, maybe write down your thoughts, it’s a great way to stay sane!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what I think. 6 months from now many of us will look back at today and revisit the boredom that they experienced and how they went about changing their relationship to it:\n“Wow, I never thought that the Crisis was such a blessing. All the time it freed up for me. I was so stressed every day, running from one obligation to another, depriving myself of spending time with my friends and family. But then, when I was forced to stay home, it kind of clicked. First, I was bored and tended to binge on Netflix, but that got boring quite quickly too. The realization came late, but when I realized that this crisis was a reminder of all that’s important in life, I quickly gained control over the situation. I remember the day that I finally found time to do what I was longing to do for so long. I eventually started”XYZ” (writing/ playing music/ learning a new language) - fill in whatever dream of yours you wanted to pursue but lacked the time to do. Damn, if it wasn’t for the crisis I might still be wondering what it was like to do “XYZ”.\nPeople who realize this fast enough will be able to act upon the newly freed time and will profit tremendously in whatever area they choose to apply it to.\n\n\nCall to arms\nFor those of you who have not already changed the Browser Tab to start another binging marathon on Netflix, firstly, thanks. Secondly, here’s the deal! I want you to take 5 minutes and think of everything that you always wanted to do but never “found time for”. Then pick one thing and start acting on it.\nAs I know that it’s always easier said than done, I encourage you to follow my lead. I’ll have a weekly posting schedule where I’ll blog about my journey of becoming a Data Scientist. I want you to engage with me and comment on what you did in your personal project.\nOk, that’s basically it. If you’re done, feel free to write a comment down below or hit me up on LinkedIn to help each other stay motivated on our journey.\n\n\nGratefulness:\nBefore ending this post I would like to give a big thank you to the following people for inspiring me to take action and embark on a crazy journey to becoming a Data Scientist:\n\nAndrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke for being kick-ass instructors that know how to ignite their students’ passion for a subject as complex as machine learning. Check out their Course if you’re interested in Data Science\nImmune Coding Institute for believing in me and giving me a chance to study Data Science at their wonderful facilities\nPedro Domingos who wrote the challenging book without whom I wouldn’t have had the curiosity to dive deeper and gather the necessary knowledge to understand his brilliant work\nMy girlfriend for preparing world-class scrambled eggs to free up time for my projects\nMy family for supporting me mentally and financially on my crazy adventures\nEpic Mountain for making inspiring music that transforms your brain into a pondering - machine!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "To be or not to be\n\nWhat I’ve learned from trying too hard.\n\nIn what follows I’ll explain how to start a new endeavor and stick with it. More concretely the notion of identity-based and goal-based achievement will be discussed in consideration of how to develop the necessary mindset that results in sustainable, repeatable and pleasurable habits which in turn will yield a fruitful ground for achievement.\nA few weeks back an excited youngster sat at his desk trying to make sense of a bad situation and assign it some meaning. He would go on to formulate his ideas in a rush of feel-good endorphins. The pounding of keys would finally end after a short distance writing-sprint. After adding a witty title here and some funny pictures there, his first written piece was ready to be published. That should do for a first blog post, right? Right. Click - post - share - ask for feedback - get lavish praise by friends - wait until next week - hope to be blessed with random sparks of creativity - write again - repeat - become a writer - mission accomplished! As if, haha! Now who am I talking about, you’re asking? - Drumroll - That someone was me. Now some of you might ask what’s your point here? Isn’t that exactly how it works? Well no, here’s why.\n\n\nGoal-Based - Efforts\nThe above-described situation perfectly demonstrates how goal-based efforts work. As I set out on my journey the only thing on my mind was the goal: “Write a blog”. Now, a goal in and of itself is not a bad thing, but neither is it good, a goal is just a goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal-Based and Identity-Based EffortsAs seen in the diagram above, goal-based efforts work from the outside in. The typical goal-setting process starts out by defining what it is that you want to achieve. Let’s say your goal is to lose weight. You begin to produce certain outcomes, like losing a pound here and there due to training and eating right. The actions you take might or might not lead to habits, that eventually become automated as you go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Finally, if you’re in luck, you’ll finally incorporate being sporty, as part of your life. This process might take weeks, months or even years in some cases, but let’s be honest, we’ve all tried and failed at something like this, which leads makes me think, that there has to be a better way. Back to the story.\nIn my last blog post I proudly claimed, that I would upload 1 post per week in order to capture my journey of becoming a Data Scientist and Writer. Well, did you see me write anything in 3 weeks? Exactly, neither did I. Why? Mostly, because the anticipated exhilarating bursts of creativity didn’t appear according to plan, which quickly let me question my ability to write. This is by no means a valid excuse, which is precisely why I’m all the more thankful for what followed!\nA little beaten down by reality, an old friend of mine, Tom, taught me a valuable lesson. He asked me the following: Are you a writer or do you want to become one? In essence: “to be or not to be?”\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who want to understand the profound contemplation behind this quote, and not just my misuse of it, check out this fun Youtube Video!\nTom went on to explain the problem with goal-based efforts. Setting goals, followed up by painstakingly following down that road, without ever stopping and asking “Why?”, is the equivalent of going on a hike without any shoes. In short, the journey will be very painful, unenjoyable and over, rather quickly. You’ll give up on your hike before it even began.\n\n\nIdentity-based efforts:\nAnother approach that works much better than goal-based efforts, is to work from the inside out and focus on your identity first, Tom said. A bit confused I asked: “what do you mean by that?” Patiently, he elaborated: Before starting out on a new journey, ask yourself these fundamentals:\n\nWhy do I want to do this? What’s the purpose of all this?\nDo I see myself doing this, 10 years from now?\nIs this something I enjoy or can come to enjoy?\nAm I willing to invest at least a couple of minutes, every day?\n\nIf the answer to most of those is “yes!”, or “I don’t know, but I’m sure as hell willing to find out”, congratulations! You’re now officially a “(fill in whatever it is that you want to be)”. You’re probably still a bloody amateur, but that’s alright.\nI pondered these questions in the back of my mind, as Tom continued teaching. “You have now started to grow. You’ve incorporated a certain topic as an integral part of your life! This is a great leap forward because now, you don’t have the pressure to reach a certain goal anymore. Shifting your perspective away from goals will allow you to view every step onwards as an opportunity to learn. You’ll be able to improve who you already are, rather than trying to become someone. This way you recognize your own imperfections and take the actions needed to even them out. Soon enough, this newfound identity you’re shaping will result in habits that positively reinforce your growth. Your efforts will materialize in outcomes and you’ll lose weight, write something or do whatever it is that you wanted to do in the first place. In summary, you’ll set yourself up for success. You might not achieve one or another thing in the short run, but you’ll never quit on your new endeavor because now it’s part of who you are!” Woah. Let that sink for a moment. It took me 2 weeks to internalize this!\n\n\nConclusion:\nSo, what’s the main takeaway and how does it all tie back to my efforts of writing blogs? What Tom taught me is to “be”, rather than “become”. The hardest part about setting out on a new journey is starting and setting yourself up for success. By accepting that you are already a writer, a runner etc. you’ll eliminate the pressure of becoming that someone. This, in turn, allows you to shift your perspective towards improving yourself. In short, don’t try hard, try smart. Remember, the following:\n\nGoal-based efforts can only get you so far\nIdentity-based efforts are a surefire way to succeed in the long run\nAsk “Why?” before you start\nBuild habits and results will follow\n\n\n\nGratefulness:\n\nThank you, Tom Munk, for opening my eyes to this fundamental truth about any effort whatsoever in life. I’m back on track and I don’t plan on derailing. I owe you a lot and I’m planning on repaying it fully!\nThank you, Andrei Neagoie, for teaching me about the truths about learning, habits and compound learning."

I’m currently writing a post about a valuable exercise I did.\nA related recurring question is whether I’d like to be a generalist or specialist. Right now I am the former. Do I want it to stay this way? How can I lean in a lot more into this and how can I become a better generalist?\nTo answer these questions I’m experimenting with coaching to help me become more excellent.\n\nThis is also related to trying to find tactics for how to get more real life feedback. I’m building this website precicely for that purpose. Occasionally, the idea of revamping my personal YouTube channel comes up.\nAn idea that might be helpful in making progress more rapidly is that of forming useful not true beliefs.\nI’m exploring how I’d like to continue my path and what kind of work I’d like to produce:\n\nI’d like to become a better leader\nI’m spending some time on exercises for how to be a better strategic thinker\n\n\nThese thoughts have been inspired by the following quote:\n\n“It’s now critically important to get into the real world and really challenge yourself. Expose yourself to risk Put yourself in situations where you will succeed or fail by your own decisions and actions, and where that success or failure will be highly visible.” - Mark Andreesen"

As part of the competition I had to review other participants entires. Find out more in my post titled “Integration by Parts for Archers”\nI’m currently working on a video about Causal Scrubbing. For this project I’m experimenting with delegating tasks via upwork to become better at managing projects and people. It’s very fun.\nI’m slowly reviewing the Mechanistic Interpretability content from the Alignment Research Engineering Accelerator (ARENA) curriculum.\nIn October I might be spending some time in Vermont to do an AI Safety related project."

Outside of work, Gerold is a dedicated dancer who’s convinced that he’s the protagonist in a scene straight out of “The Scent of a Woman.” He’s also the proud parent of two dogs and an unabashed victim of Kay’s nerd sniping.\nDespite living far from Italy, Gerold has a romantic notion of the country that he believes adds a dash of charm to his personality. If he’s not crunching numbers or practicing his tango, you might find him training for ultra-long-distance hikes. He recently finished a 56 km hike in a single day and he’s aiming for the 100 km mark. Who says AI engineers can’t be outdoorsy?"

    "text": "Kay Kozaronek\n\n\n\nKay’s Image\n\n\nIn the world of machine learning, Kay is a research engineer who’s on a mission to ensure advanced AI systems are as safe as a cushioned playground. With a background in management consulting and startup experience, Kay sees the creation of these safe AI systems as the most pivotal challenge of our time. His research focuses on the interpretability of large language models, a task as complex as figuring out what his partner wants for dinner.\nKay values clear communication, honest feedback, and a good dad joke. If you ever need a pun to lighten the mood, he’s your guy. When he’s not deciphering AI or cracking jokes, you’ll likely find him immersed in sports, creating music on his piano or guitar, or simply spreading smiles.\nIf he hadn’t taken up the mantle of AI safety, Kay would probably be a jazz cat, hopping from city to city, playing soulful tunes in smoky jazz clubs with strangers. Fortunately for us, his love for AI is as strong as his love for music.\nKay is particularly proud of his 3-month solo trek through South America, during which he visited 7 countries and picked up Spanish, all without any prior knowledge. The adventure is captured in a series of vlogs on YouTube, showcasing Kay’s quirky documentation style. He’s also incredibly proud of his transition from business administration student to professional AI Safety researcher, thanks to nearly two years of self-study and a grant from OpenPhilanthropy. Talk about a plot twist!"
