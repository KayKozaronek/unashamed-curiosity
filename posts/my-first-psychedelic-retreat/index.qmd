# Experience Report

## 1. Encountering "How to Change Your Mind - Michael Pollan"

The journey began long before I booked the retreat or even decided that psychedelics could be a part of my life. It started with a book. Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” found its way into my hands almost serendipitously. Pollan’s meticulous research and eloquent prose about the transformative potential of psychedelics struck a chord with me. His exploration into the science, history, and personal narratives surrounding substances like LSD, psilocybin and mescaline planted a seed of curiosity. Pollan’s balanced approach—acknowledging both the profound insights and the inherent risks—made the idea of a psychedelic journey seem both intriguing and plausible.

## 2. Finding myself in a dark place 
In the months leading up to the retreat, I found myself in a dark place, grappling with a myriad of challenges that piled into an insurmountable mountain of physical and mental stress. My interest in psilocybin began with its medical applications for depression and terminally ill cancer patients. However, I soon wondered if this medicine could help me, an otherwise healthy individual, navigate my own dark night and find daylight.

Professionally, I was grappling with significant uncertainties and doubts about my career path, culminating in a burnout that compelled me to take a week off work and subsequently reduce my working hours for an entire month by 20%. The stagnation in progress at the nonprofit I founded left me feeling unfulfilled and incompetent, constantly questioning whether I was on the right track.

Personally, conflicts among loved ones left me in a constant state of mediation, significantly affecting my well-being. Additionally, I had recently moved to Krakow and didn't have many close in-person friends yet. Although it's easy to make acquaintances, deep friendships take time to develop, and that time simply hadn't passed yet. I was left with barely anyone to talk to.

On top of these professional and personal challenges, I was dealing with a profound sense of disconnection from my community. Before moving to Krakow, I lived in intellectually stimulating environments like London and Berkeley, surrounded by a community of like-minded rationalists, AI Safety Practitioners, and Effective Altruists. I felt out of sync with the world around me, unable to find a community in Krakow where I truly belonged. This feeling of alienation left me emotionally raw and vulnerable. Integrating my behaviors and mental models made it difficult to maintain meaningful connections and it often left me feeling isolated and misunderstood.

In addition to these psychological stressors, I had traveled a lot (on average 8 days / month for 6 months) to different time zones and places all the while training for my first marathon. This left me physically challenged, adding additional, self imposed and certainly positive, but draining stressors.

The weight of these issues became almost unbearable. I was constantly anxious and unable to find peace even in moments of quiet. My daily gratitude practice felt like a chore, and monitoring my composure became the only practical way to manage my anger outbursts. Every day felt like a battle against an invisible enemy, leaving me desperate for a way out of the darkness.

This overwhelming confluence of stressors led me to seek a radical solution: psychedelic-assisted therapy. I hoped a psilocybin retreat would provide the clarity, new perspective, and reconnection with myself and the world that I desperately needed. Attending the retreat represented a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak and overwhelming landscape.


## 3. Researching Various Retreats

Inspired by Michael Pollan’s detailed accounts of transformative psychedelic experiences, I embarked on a meticulous quest to find a retreat that would align with my personal needs and aspirations. The research process was extensive and demanding. I delved into countless online reviews, contacted 16 different retreat representatives, and rigorously scrutinized the qualifications of various facilitators.

My primary criteria included cost and the legal status of the retreat’s location. Secondary considerations were the type of psychedelic medicine used, retreat duration, the earliest available start date, and the rapport I felt with the facilitators. Unfortunately, in my eagerness, I overlooked the critical aspect of professionalism and didn’t pay enough attention to the rapport I felt with the facilitators.

I sought a retreat environment conducive to deep psychological exploration, one that offered robust support and expert guidance to help me navigate the potentially challenging terrains of a psychedelic journey. After carefully weighing all my options, I chose a retreat in the Netherlands that promised a comprehensive approach: some pre-ceremony preparation, a guided psilocybin journey, and a post-ceremony integration sessions. It was a no-frills choice but was reasonably priced at 240 Euros, significantly lower than most other retreats, which started at 1800 Euros.

In all sincerity, I was quite stressed about making the right choice, wary of saving on price at the potential expense of retreat quality. I was very nervous about choosing a retreat because I didn’t fully connect with either of the representatives of my final 2 options. Both seemed too “businessy” in their approach, treating me like a customer, which heightened my concerns about their sincerity and professionalism — concerns I should have heeded.

My partner advised me that I might not be ready and suggested waiting before making a decision. Ultimately, I think it’s good that I went because postponing it might have led to never going at all. However, she was right about how rushed my final decision felt in comparison to my research. I spent a few days ruminating before deciding to attend a retreat about one week later. It was initially planned for two weeks later, but the retreat was already booked, which forced me to rush. Those weren’t ideal conditions for retreat preparation.

## 4. The Retreat

### Day 1  

#### Preparation and Travel 

The day began with a sense of anticipation mixed with anxiety. I made my way to the airport at 03:30 for the early morning flight from Krakow to Amsterdam. In the airport lobby, I found myself revisiting and refining my intentions for the retreat — Clarity, Confidence, and Composure. The “3C’s” were meant to guide me through the myriad of challenges in my life, from professional uncertainties to personal relationships and a sense of community belonging. I was mentally preparing for what I hoped would be a profound journey into my subconscious.

#### Arrival

Upon arrival at the retreat, my initial feelings of anticipation quickly gave way to unease. The facilitators could not specify the exact psilocybin content in the truffles we were to consume. Although they assured us that 30 grams of fresh truffles was an appropriate dose, their lack of detailed knowledge about the psilocybin content raised my skepticism. Knowing that mushrooms typically contain between 0.5% - 2.0% psilocybin, and that a moderate dose for a first-time user is around 1.5 grams, I was alarmed. A ‘heroic dose’ of 5 grams, as termed by Terence McKenna, seemed daunting. Yet, we were assured that 30 grams of truffles would be fine.

“I took 30 grams last week plus an MAO inhibitor and it was fine,” was one of the facilitator’s responses. Another added, “Don’t worry. You have to think less. You are way too much in your head. Each trip is different. Gender, height, weight, none of it matters because everyone reacts differently.” Another participant, who would later have a panic attack, and I were the only ones who had read up on dosage amounts and expressed concerns. After the retreat, I learned from a Google search that truffles could contain between 0.2% and 0.6% psilocybin. Without precise information beforehand, I was left to wonder about the potency and safety of what I was about to ingest. This initial uncertainty set a tone of caution and mistrust.

:::callout-tip
MAO inhibitors (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) are a class of drugs that prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their availability. When combined with psilocybin, MAO inhibitors can enhance and prolong the effects by preventing the breakdown of psilocybin into psilocin. This can lead to more intense and longer-lasting trips.

#### Sharing Circle (Part 1 - Katharsis & Bonding)

Once all participants arrived, we began the first structured activity: a sharing circle. Each participant and the facilitators were invited to share their backgrounds, the challenges they faced, and their hopes for the retreat. This exercise was designed to foster a sense of community and mutual support. As I listened to others’ stories of struggle and hope, I felt a profound sense of connection and empathy. Hearing the raw, honest experiences of others made me realize I was not alone in my journey. When my turn came, I opened up about my own life’s challenges. The act of sharing was emotionally overwhelming, and I found myself crying as I spoke. However, this release felt liberating — a moment of catharsis. This was the first glimmer of the healing I hoped to find at the retreat. Additionally, it was empowering to help others by listening to their stories. We built an initial reservoir of trust within the group. The facilitators did an excellent job in helping us open up and providing the space to express ourselves. The healing properties of hearing and being heard were nothing short of miraculous.

#### The Ceremony (Part 1 - Intention Setting)

With the sharing session complete, we moved into the ceremony room to set our intentions for the psilocybin journey. We sat in front of candles, each lighting one for ourselves while thanking Mother Earth and expressing our wishes to the truffles. As each person took their turn, the room filled with a collective sense of purpose. When my turn came, I lit my candle and voiced my hopes for clarity, confidence, and composure.

Once we finished, we took our spots on the mattresses that had been prepared for us. In the “trip journal” I brought for this occasion, I wrote down, “Be brave and heal”. This act of intention-setting felt like a ritual, grounding me in the purpose of the journey ahead. I took a last look at the token I brought with me: a Polaroid of my partner and me on Christmas Eve underneath a mistletoe.

The facilitators then made their rounds through the room, approaching each bed individually to wish each participant a good journey and hand them the medicine. They served the truffles in a small translucent bowl, accompanied by a twig of a needle tree, a small pot of honey, and a menthol candy. As they approached my bed, I felt the massive weight of my life challenges looming over me, and I cracked under their weight, tears the size of grapes rolling down my cheeks. I reminded myself, “Be brave and heal.” -->

#### The Ceremony (Part 2 - Trembling, Laughter and Anticipation)

The ingestion of the 30 grams of truffles marked the beginning of the journey. As the psilocybin started to take effect, I felt a mixture of physical sensations — trembling, tingling, and waves of laughter. These initial stages were characterized by a sense of anticipation and openness. I was ready to embrace whatever insights the experience would bring by consistently asking the truffles: “What are you trying to teach me?”

#### The Ceremony (Part 3 - Challenges & Paranoia)

As the trip deepened, challenges emerged. The music, a crucial part of the experience, stopped playing twice. This technical glitch, coupled with the facilitators’ visible inability to fix it promptly, shattered my sense of safety and trust. My paranoia escalated as I observed other participants in distress—vomiting, experiencing panic attacks, and crying heavily. These reactions, normal under the influence of MAO inhibitors combined with psilocybin, felt alarming and intensified my distrust. The atmosphere in the room became tense, and I began to suspect that we were being drugged or deceived.

#### The Ceremony (Part 4 - "Felt" Insights)

Despite the paranoia, there were moments of profound insight. I grappled with existential questions and the nature of reality. I felt a strong urge to connect with nature, to understand the concept of fearlessness, and to embrace love. However, these insights were frequently interrupted by the facilitators’ incompetence and my escalating distrust. The experience was a chaotic mix of profound realizations and deep-seated fears.

#### Post Ceremony (Part 1 - The Afterglow)

As the effects of the psilocybin began to wane, there was a brief period of calm and reflection. I tried to process the whirlwind of emotions and insights from the trip. The facilitators encouraged us to share our immediate feelings, but my distrust had not abated. I felt alienated from the group and skeptical of the facilitators’ ability to provide genuine support.

#### Post Ceremony (Part 2 - The Rejected Apology)

That evening, I sought out Jacqueline to apologize for my disruptive behavior during the ceremony. I wanted to reconcile and understand her perspective, hoping it might provide some closure. However, Jacqueline dismissed me, telling me to wait until the next day. This rejection deepened my feelings of isolation and remorse.

#### Post Ceremony (Part 3 - The Accepted Apology)

The following day, during the reflection session, I apologized to the group for my actions. Some participants accepted my apology, but Jacqueline’s response was particularly harsh. She accused me of psychopathic behaviors and questioned my character in a way that felt both unprofessional and damaging. Her feedback was delivered at a time when I was most vulnerable, compounding the emotional turmoil I was already experiencing.

### Day 2 

#### Sharing Circle (Part 2 - Shame and Alienation)

The second sharing circle was meant to help us process our experiences, but I felt a profound sense of shame and alienation. Other participants shared their transformative insights, while I was preoccupied with the facilitators' accusations and my own feelings of failure. The sense of community that had been built on the first day felt fractured.

#### The Accusation: You're a Psychopath, Where Were Your Insights? You Owe Your Child. Your Life is So Fucked Up.

During a private conversation, Jacqueline told me that she believed I had psychopathic tendencies and that my life was "so fucked up." She suggested I seek psychological help for the sake of my future child. Her words were a harsh blow, delivered without the empathy or professionalism I had expected from a retreat leader. This accusation left me questioning not just my behavior during the trip but my overall character and worth.

## 5. Post Retreat 
  
### Day 3,4 & 5

#### Time with Family and Friends 
Returning to my family and friends was both comforting and challenging. I shared my experiences, but the depth of my turmoil was difficult to convey. Their support was unwavering, but I felt a lingering sense of isolation and confusion.

#### Sports (Swim, Bike, Run) 
Engaging in physical activities like swimming, biking, and running became a therapeutic outlet. These activities grounded me and provided a sense of normalcy amidst the emotional chaos.

#### Some Journaling
I journaled extensively, trying to make sense of the experience and its aftermath. Writing allowed me to process my thoughts and emotions, but it was also a reminder of the unresolved questions and lingering doubts.

#### Unfortunately Unhealthy Food 
During this period, my diet slipped into unhealthy patterns. The stress and emotional upheaval made it difficult to maintain healthy eating habits, which only added to my sense of frustration.

#### Could Have Done Less and Shouldn't Have Watched TV 
In hindsight, I realized that I could have benefitted from more rest and solitude. Watching TV and engaging in other distractions prevented me from fully processing the experience and integrating the insights.

#### Should Have Spent More Time by Myself or with Someone Who Understands That I Need Space 
I should have spent more time alone or with someone who understood my need for space and introspection. Being constantly surrounded by people, even those who cared for me, sometimes felt overwhelming and counterproductive.

#### Returning Back Home 
Returning home marked the end of the retreat but not the end of its impact. The journey back was a time of reflection, trying to piece together the fragments of my experience and understand its implications.

#### Sharing News About Pregnancy with My Family and Friends
Amidst the chaos, there was a moment of joy when I shared the news of the pregnancy with my family and friends. Their happiness and support provided a welcome respite from the turmoil of the retreat.

### Post Ceremony Reflections

#### Sharing Ceremony Experiences with
**Partner**
Discussing the retreat with my partner was crucial. She had been my anchor during the experience, especially when I felt lost and paranoid. Her perspective helped me see aspects of the journey I might have missed and provided emotional support as I processed what had happened.

**Mother**
Sharing my experience with my mother was both

cathartic and challenging. She listened with empathy, and her concern was palpable. Talking to her helped me articulate some of the confusion and fear I had felt during the retreat. Her maternal support provided a sense of comfort and reassurance, even as she struggled to understand the depths of my experience.

**Father**
My conversation with my father was a turning point. His rational and analytical approach helped me dissect the events of the retreat more objectively. He helped me recognize the unprofessionalism and abuse from the facilitators, validating my feelings of mistrust and paranoia. This discussion was instrumental in helping me regain a sense of clarity and perspective.

**Friends**
Sharing with friends provided a mix of reactions, from curiosity to concern. Their varied perspectives helped me see the experience from different angles. Some were intrigued by the idea of a psychedelic journey, while others were worried about the potential psychological impact. These conversations reinforced the importance of a supportive and understanding community when processing such profound experiences.

**Aunt**
My aunt, who had a more spiritual outlook, offered insights that bridged the gap between the mystical and the rational aspects of my journey. She emphasized the importance of integrating the experience into my daily life and finding meaning in the chaos. Her guidance was a soothing counterpoint to the more clinical perspectives I had encountered.

**Coach (Adam)**
Discussing the retreat with my coach, Adam, was a structured and therapeutic process. He helped me break down the experience into manageable parts, reflecting on both the challenges and the insights. His professional approach provided a safe space to explore my emotions and develop strategies for future journeys. His questions and reflections helped me articulate my thoughts more clearly and identify actionable steps for healing and growth.
