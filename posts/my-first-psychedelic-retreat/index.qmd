# Experience Report

## 1. Encountering "How to Change Your Mind - Michael Pollan"

The journey began long before I booked the retreat or even decided that psychedelics could be a part of my life. It started with a book. Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” found its way into my hands almost serendipitously. Pollan’s meticulous research and eloquent prose about the transformative potential of psychedelics struck a chord with me. His exploration into the science, history, and personal narratives surrounding substances like LSD, psilocybin and mescaline planted a seed of curiosity. Pollan’s balanced approach — acknowledging both the profound insights and the inherent risks — made the idea of a psychedelic journey seem both intriguing and plausible.

## 2. Finding myself in a dark place 
In the months leading up to the retreat, I found myself in a dark place, grappling with a myriad of challenges that piled into an insurmountable mountain of physical and mental stress. My interest in psilocybin began with its medical applications for depression and terminally ill cancer patients. However, I soon wondered if this medicine could help me, an otherwise healthy individual, navigate my own dark night and find daylight.

Professionally, I was grappling with significant uncertainties and doubts about my career path, culminating in a burnout that compelled me to take a week off work and subsequently reduce my working hours for an entire month by 20%. The stagnation in progress at the nonprofit I founded left me feeling unfulfilled and incompetent, constantly questioning whether I was on the right track.

Personally, conflicts among loved ones left me in a constant state of mediation, significantly affecting my well-being. There's nothing more effective at bringing you down than having two of the most significant people in your life fight, lose trust in each other, and break ties, leaving you as the only hair-thin string holding together the massive, bridgeless raft they created. Additionally, I had recently moved to Krakow and didn't have many close in-person friends yet. Although it's easy to make acquaintances, deep friendships take time to develop, and that time simply hadn't passed yet. I was left with barely anyone to talk to.

On top of these professional and personal challenges, I was dealing with a profound sense of disconnection from my community. Before moving to Krakow, I lived in intellectually stimulating environments like London and Berkeley, surrounded by a network of like-minded rationalists, AI Safety researchers, and Effective Altruists. I felt out of sync with the world around me, unable to find a community in Krakow where I truly belonged. This feeling of alienation left me emotionally raw and vulnerable. Previously appreciated behaviors and mental models made turned into weird conversational artfacts that made it difficult to maintain meaningful connections. I was often left feeling isolated and misunderstood.

In addition to these psychological stressors, I had traveled a lot (on average 8 days / month for 6 months) to different time zones and places all the while training for my first marathon. This left me physically challenged, adding additional, self imposed and certainly positive, but draining stressors.

The weight of these issues became almost unbearable. I was constantly anxious and unable to find peace even in moments of quiet. My daily gratitude practice felt like a chore, and monitoring my composure became the only practical way to manage my anger outbursts. Every day felt like a battle against an invisible enemy, leaving me desperate for a way out of the darkness.

This overwhelming confluence of stressors led me to seek a radical solution: psychedelic-assisted therapy. I hoped a psilocybin retreat would provide the clarity, new perspective, and reconnection with myself and the world that I desperately needed. Attending the retreat represented a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak and overwhelming landscape.


## 3. Researching Various Retreats

Inspired by Michael Pollan’s detailed accounts of transformative psychedelic experiences, I embarked on a quest to find a retreat that would align with my personal needs and aspirations. The research process was extensive and demanding. I delved into countless online reviews, talked to 16 different retreat representatives, and scrutinized the qualifications of various facilitators.

My primary criteria included cost and the legal status of the retreat’s location. Secondary considerations were the type of psychedelic medicine used, retreat duration, the earliest available start date, and the rapport I felt with the facilitators. Unfortunately, in my eagerness, I overlooked the critical aspect of professionalism and underestimated how much attention I should have paid to the rapport I felt with the facilitators.

I sought a retreat environment conducive to deep psychological exploration, one that offered robust support and expert guidance to help me navigate the potentially challenging terrains of a psychedelic journey. After carefully weighing all my options, I chose a retreat in the Netherlands that promised a comprehensive approach: some pre-ceremony preparation, a guided psilocybin journey, and a post-ceremony integration sessions. It was a no-frills choice but was reasonably priced at 240 Euros, significantly lower than most other retreats, which started at 1800 Euros.

# General Purchasing Heuristic
When faced with purchasing decisions for items I'm uncertain about, I typically choose the cheapest option. This approach allows me to test the product and determine if it meets my expectations. I evaluate how frequently I use it and whether it provides the desired value. Often, the inexpensive choice is flawed in some unanticipated ways, quickly revealing if an upgrade is necessary. If I decide to upgrade, I then select the best option available within my budget constraints.  
:::

In all sincerity, I was quite stressed about making the right choice, wary of saving on price at the potential expense of retreat quality. Using my General Purchasing Heuristic didn't seem appropriate for an experience as important as this. What if I would have a bad trip? In addition, I was very nervous about choosing a retreat because I didn’t fully connect with either of the representatives of my final 2 options. Both seemed too “businessy” in their approach, treating me like a customer, which heightened my concerns about their sincerity and professionalism — concerns I should have heeded. 

My partner advised that I might not be ready and suggested waiting before making a decision. Ultimately, I think it's good that I went because postponing it might have led to never going at all. However, she was right about how rushed my final decision felt compared to my research. I spent a few days ruminating before deciding to attend a retreat scheduled for two weeks later. A day after my booking, it turned out that the retreat was already at full capacity, and I was offered a spot one week earlier instead. This left me feeling rushed and robbed of an additional week of mental preparation. These weren’t ideal conditions for retreat preparation, but I went ahead anyway. Soon enough, between booking flights, informing friends and family about my trip, and setting my intentions, the day of the retreat arrived.

## 4. The Retreat

### Day 1  

#### Preparation and Travel 

The day began with a sense of anticipation mixed with anxiety. I made my way to the airport at 03:30 for the early morning flight from Krakow to Amsterdam. In the airport lobby, I found myself revisiting and refining my intentions for the retreat: Clarity, Confidence, and Composure. These "3 C’s" were meant to guide me through the myriad of challenges in my life, from professional uncertainties to personal relationships and a sense of community belonging. I was mentally preparing for what I hoped would be a profound journey.

To arrive at my intention, I wrote out a few things that were on my mind that morning. In the original document, I highlighted the important points. It turned out that professional and AGI-related thoughts were much less pronounced and important during the trip than I had assumed. Here’s what I wrote:

> - How should I prioritize the many challenges in my life?
    - Professional / Work
        - What do I want to work on?
    - Parenthood & my partnership
        - How can I give my child the best life possible?
        - How will our relationship be affected during and after the pregnancy?
        - Do we still want to explore polyamory during or after the pregnancy?
    - Community
        - Krakow, London & Berkeley. Where do I belong?
    - Cognitive dissonance
        - What do I value?
        - What do I want from life?
        - Why am I so obsessed with excellence?
        - Why do I think so poorly of myself?
    - What do I really believe when it comes to AGI?
        - What about timelines?
        - How should my beliefs influence all other decisions I make?
    - Sports / Triathlon & Ironman
        - Do I really want this?
    - Friendships
        - How can I retrain friendships & build new strong connections?
    - Vacation
        - How can I be fine with spending money on leisure?
        - Where do I want to go?
        - How should I define a budget for this?

While writing, I felt that I was lacking clarity in what to prioritize, confidence in my decisions and actions, and the composure necessary to enjoy activities like vacation planning instead of stressing out about them. Voilà, the 3 C’s were synthesized.

#### Arrival

The flight was uneventful, and the ensuing train trip from the airport to the retreat location was calm. I managed to buy a small notebook, a “trip journal”, to accompany me on my trip and started journaling right away.

Upon arrival at the retreat, my initial feelings of anticipation quickly gave way to unease. The facilitators could not specify the exact psilocybin content in the truffles we were to consume. Although they assured us that 30 grams of fresh truffles was an appropriate dose, their lack of detailed knowledge about the psilocybin content raised my skepticism. Knowing that mushrooms typically contain between 0.5% - 2.0% psilocybin, and that a moderate dose for a first-time user is around 1.5 grams, I was alarmed. A ‘heroic dose’ of 5 grams, as termed by Terence McKenna, seemed daunting. Yet, we were assured that 30 grams of truffles would be fine.

:::callout-tip
Terence McKenna (1946-2000) was an American ethnobotanist, mystic, psychonaut, lecturer, and author. He is best known for his advocacy of the use of naturally occurring psychedelic substances, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, and ayahuasca. McKenna's work focused on the potential of these substances to catalyze profound personal and cultural transformation.

One of his notable contributions to psychedelic culture is the concept of the "heroic dose" — a high dose of psilocybin mushrooms, typically around 5 grams, taken in a safe and controlled environment. He believed that such a dose could facilitate deep and transformative experiences, allowing individuals to access the far reaches of their consciousness.
:::

“I took 30 grams last week plus an MAO inhibitor and it was fine,” was one of the facilitator’s responses. Another added, “Don’t worry. You have to think less. You are way too much in your head. Each trip is different. Gender, height, weight, none of it matters because everyone reacts differently.” Another participant, who would later have a panic attack, and I were the only ones who had read up on dosage amounts and expressed concerns. After the retreat, I learned from a Google search that truffles contain between 0.2% and 0.6% psilocybin. The lower potency meant that a larger dosage is required to achieve similar effects as with normal mushrooms. However, without precise information beforehand, I was left to wonder about the potency and safety of what I was about to ingest. This initial uncertainty set a tone of caution and mistrust.

:::callout-tip
MAO inhibitors (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) are a class of drugs that prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their availability. When combined with psilocybin, MAO inhibitors can enhance and prolong the effects by preventing the breakdown of psilocybin into psilocin. This can lead to more intense and longer-lasting trips.
:::
 
#### Sharing Circle - Katharsis & Bonding

Once all participants arrived, we began the first structured activity: a sharing circle. Each participant and the facilitators were invited to share their backgrounds, the challenges they faced, and their hopes for the retreat. This exercise was designed to foster a sense of community and mutual support. As I listened to others’ stories of struggle and hope, I felt a profound sense of connection and empathy. Hearing the raw, honest experiences of others made me realize I was not alone in my journey.

When my turn came, I opened up about my own life’s challenges. The act of sharing was emotionally overwhelming, and I found myself crying as I spoke. The release felt liberating — a moment of catharsis. This was the first glimmer of the healing I hoped to find at the retreat. Additionally, it was empowering to help others by listening to their stories. We built an initial reservoir of trust within the group. The facilitators did an excellent job of helping us open up and providing the space to express ourselves. The healing properties of hearing and being heard were nothing short of miraculous.

#### The Ceremony - Intention Setting (Part 1)

With the sharing session complete, we changed into more comfortable clothes and moved into the ceremony room to set our intentions for the psilocybin journey. We sat in front of an altar of candles, each lighting one for ourselves while thanking Mother Earth and expressing our wishes for the journey with the truffles. As each person took their turn, the room filled with a collective sense of purpose. When my turn came, I lit my candle and voiced my hopes for clarity, confidence, and composure.

Once we finished, we took our spots on the mattresses that had been prepared for us. In the “trip journal” I brought for this occasion, I wrote down, “Be brave and heal.” This act of intention-setting felt like a ritual, grounding me in the purpose of the journey ahead. I took a last look at the token I brought with me: a Polaroid of my partner and me on Christmas Eve underneath a mistletoe.

The facilitators then made their rounds through the room, approaching each bed individually to wish each participant a good journey and hand them the medicine. They served the truffles in a small translucent bowl, accompanied by a twig of a needle tree, a small pot of honey, and a menthol candy. As they approached my bed, I felt the massive weight of my life challenges looming over me, and I cracked under their weight, tears the size of grapes rolling down my cheeks. I reminded myself, “Be brave and heal.”

#### The Ceremony - The first Challenge (Part 2)

The ingestion of the 30 grams of truffles marked the beginning of the journey. These initial stages, before the psilocybin took effect, were characterized by a sense of anticipation and openness. I was ready to embrace whatever insights the experience would bring by consistently asking, “What are you trying to teach me?”. As the psilocybin started to take effect, I felt a mixture of physical sensations — trembling, tingling, and waves of laughter.

At first, the trip was positive. However, as the experience deepened, the first challenge emerged. The music, a crucial part of the experience, stopped playing. I took off my eyeshades, curious and concerned about what was happening. Three facilitators were huddling around the sound system, unable to get it to work, disrupting the collective journey with their apparent incompetence.


At the same time, the group leader was absent. Someone went to fetch her, and she soon appeared, acknowledging the problem but trying to downplay it. She realized that the situation wasn't ideal, but that the others are going to figure it out. In the meantime she played some music on a handpan.

The soft sound of the handpan, a kind of steel drum, was soothing. I decided to resume my journey, putting my eyeshades back on and trying to relax. I told myself: "Fair enough, humans make mistakes". For a while, I felt one with the soft, wavy sounds from the drums. Eventually, the facilitators managed to get the music working again, and the ceremony continued smoothly for a time.

#### The Ceremony - Musical Fallout (Part 3)

The music stopped again. Initially, I laughed at the loud sound when the aux cable was removed, but as the silence continued, my irritation grew. This technical glitch, combined with the facilitators’ visible inability to fix it promptly, shattered my sense of safety and trust. Paranoia set in as I thought, “Why don’t these people know what they are doing? They don’t know how to 'hold space.'”

I lifted my eyeshade and saw participants in distress — some vomiting, others panicking or crying heavily. What had previously seemed amusing now felt concerning. The atmosphere grew tense, and my distrust intensified. The facilitators were roaming around, looking suspiciously at each other and at me, reflecting my growing paranoia.

I began to suspect something was very wrong. “These people don’t know what they’re doing, or worse, they tricked us,” I thought. My mind raced with thoughts of being drugged and the unprofessionalism of the facilitators. “Why did I trust them? They said it would be fine, but this is a nightmare.”

I wrote in my journal:
> How do I know if anything is real? I don’t understand any of this. I should be in nature. Am I having a bad trip?

A tall, muscular, tattooed facilitator, whom I’ll call "Big G," noticed my distress and tried to calm me. However, his limited English made it difficult to communicate effectively. His presence wasn’t enough to reassure me. I asked, "How can I trust you if we don't speak the same language?"

Somehow, Big G managed to calm me and convince me to "trust and let go". I assured myself that it's going to be fine and that I shouldn't worry. I thought, "Okay, I'm here to trust, be brave and heal."


#### The Ceremony - Detergent Drama (Part 4)

And so I lay down, put on my eyeshade again, and eventually, they got the music playing. But the melodies that filled the room were not what I expected. This one had voices and sounded like underground techno. It felt very odd, increasing my feelings of suspicion and paranoia. I didn't like this at all.

At this point, it sounds like a bad trip, but I was convinced that I wasn't having a bad trip because I was still capable of handling it. The experience wasn't pleasant but not scary either. I reminded myself to ask the experience: "What are you trying to teach me?"

But at that moment, one of the caregivers sprayed something around me to flavor the air. That's expected, but the way she did it was really weird. When I took off my eyeshades a few moments earlier, I saw her cleaning the bookshelf with some sort of detergent.

She held a paper towel in the air and sprayed the detergent on it. Then she smelled the tissue, looked at her co-workers with a funny, slightly disgusted look, shrugged, and used the towel to clean the shelf.

To me, this looked absurd. Moments later, she was walking around with the same paper towel, moving it back and forth to spread the scent. It was really bizarre. I was expecting the facilitators to walk around with scented candles or burnt herbs and spices, not cleaning detergent that they themselves thought smelled weird. Again, I was like, "What's going on here?"

The woman with the scented tissue came closer at some point, and I took off my eyeshades and asked her, "What are you doing? You seem like you have no clue what you're doing."

The evidence of the staff's incompetence started piling up. It seemed almost like a circus. It felt like they had just read about these journeys and started offering them without being truly inspired or informed by meaningful research. 

Another indication was that not everyone had eyeshades. This is supposed to be one of the most important things besides headphones. Yet, they didn't have any headphones and played music from a large box for the entire room. At that point, I just thought, "This is weird, this is odd, I'm not feeling it, I think I'm stuck here. That's bad." 

I thought, "Okay, I have some willpower, I can do stuff, I can talk, I can move. This is not too bad. I'm quite present. I'm awake, not drunk. I can move my limbs. Yes, I can't formulate super tight and bulletproof thoughts, but I know something's wrong here, and I think I should speak up."

#### The Ceremony - "I Have a Voice" (Part 5)

I looked around and saw that everyone was having a bad time. I thought, "This is the stuff out of which movies are made later on when someone writes about their experience, and they make a Netflix documentary about it. This is how we escaped this drama and nightmare of a psilocybin trip."

I thought, "This story always has somebody who speaks up at some point, right? I think I am that person. Nobody else is going to do it." So, I started saying stuff like, "I have a voice."

It was strictly forbidden to speak during the ceremony. Big G came closer again and said, "Wow, what the hell are you doing, man?"

Instead of "holding space" for me and helping me make sense of the situation, he tried to put me back on my mattress by touching my arms. I reacted, "Whoa, don't touch me. In the preparation, you said you would not touch the participants, and yet you're doing it right now. This clearly shows to me that you don't respect your own rules. Do you know what you're doing?"

Quickly, another piece of evidence popped up. Prior to the retreat, we received an email saying we shouldn't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, yet five minutes before the ceremony, they allowed a participant to smoke a cigarette. I thought, "Wow, this is so unprofessional."

I continued to feel justified in my behavior and thought, "Okay, this is happening. I do have a voice, let me speak." Big G told me I couldn't speak, and I replied, "Of course I can." At this point, I was convinced they were plotting against us and wanted to steal our stuff while we were drugged. I told Big G I wanted to see my stuff. He couldn't handle the situation, so he called another facilitator, an older person whose eyes were more trust-inducing. 

He told me I couldn't speak or see my stuff. I asked, "Why not?" He said something about the ceremony, but it wasn't a good reason. "You're not explaining it well. Why can't I see my stuff?" I insisted. After multiple requests and him going to the kitchen and back to talk to the ceremony master, who, again, wasn't in the room, he finally told me I could see my stuff.


<!--
#### The Ceremony - Eyes wide open (Part 6) 
As I left the ceremony room, I entered the kitch and found the ceremony master looking at me in disgust, saying "Oh, you want to see your belongings? Really? You're making a fool of yourself"

Not only was this unprofessionaly, but she was also eating a Nutella white bread sandwich while unleashing her judgement on me. I'd like to take a second to appreciate the absurdity of this. The whole point of a retreat like this is to promote healthy behaviors, healing and good nutrition and  the ceremony master was eating the least healthy thing that I could muster. 

- I went to see my stuff and it was all there 
- I came back to the kitchen and told the ceremony master that she should be there 
- She said that I cannot expect that from her and that I should go back to the room 
- I called her out on being super brisk and I felt like she dropped her "let's heal together" mask to replace it with a nutella eating "you are just business for me" mask.
- She said I'm making a fool of myself  
- I told them they made me take 30 grams of truffles but they insisted that I did it myself
- They started repeating that I signed a contract, which was totally misplaced. So much for, "holding space".
- I quickly agreed, it was my decision. A bad one. 
 
- I looked at my belongings and thought that the were sort of pathetic (wet swimming pants, an old shabby waterbottle, a V-neck tshirt I didn't like and a smartphone whose camera was broken)
- I wanted to see my own body and see what it was like with these new "reality - eyes". I wanted to know whether I am indeed pathetic.
- She told me I cannot undress and that she's not buying my things 

:::callout-tip
Side note, I'm referring here to the common jargon in the psychedelic and other healing practices jargon. Holding space is basically the facilitator's or shaman's responsibility while somebody is on a trip, to give them the room necessary, an emotional room, to express anything that they're feeling, and not to judge them. 
::: 

The facilitators at this retreat totally failed me on this, and this is the biggest thing that I think they didn't manage well. The ceremony master, told me that she's "not buying my act", when I was having insights, real insights, in the kitchen. 



> The importance of fearlessness! Be specific. Accept beauty. I want to remember. I want to embrace love. Give me a language for love. Everything has a price. Trust and let go? Many more questions than answers. What are rules? Why am I not supposed to talk? Decisions seem to be everything. I can shape everything. I am ACTION MAN! This is too hectic.

###### WRITE ABOUT THE CAR - PLANE THOUGHTS


I told two of the other facilitators, about a few things that I realized, and honestly, deeply felt. And they told me, in a, what I perceived to be sarcastic, undertone: "Oh wow, how deep, that's a great insight. Go back to the ceremony room, and have some more insights. Go have a journey, you will see. You'll have a journey, it'll be great." It felt like the largest platitude on earth, "Go have a journey!" 

I think I was a tough customer.

I don't think they had ever dealt with somebody like me there, otherwise they would have had more experience and would have helped me cope better and helped me get back to being calm.

In addition, their faces seemed so fake. I tried to analyze their mimicry and asked the facilitators for a hug to grasp their intentions. Upon closer inspection, I couldn't see any genuineness on their face. I would have gotten back to my bed if I did see a genuine smile. I felt like they trapped me in this goddamn house, trying to rob me of the life I still had ahead of me. This felt especially bad in connection with the "You signed a contract, you took the 30 grams of mushrooms" type thing. Especially because the contract was also not very professionally designed, and they initially didn't have enough contracts in English, which meant that I nearly ended up signing a contract that was in Dutch.

<!-- Conversation with Adam

So I left the ceremony room and entered the kitchen, which was the next room over. The ceremony leader was there, and when she saw me, she said, "Oh gosh, you want to get your stuff?"

Sure. I was shocked. Just moments prior, maybe an hour and a half ago, I had been pouring out my heart to these people, sharing my story, explaining everything that had happened to me, where I was in life, and the problems I was facing. I cried and had this cathartic moment where sharing all of this felt wonderful. Being heard and feeling the group's support was already incredibly healing, even before the ceremony started.

And now, here we were an hour later, and it hit me right in the face. The ceremony master, who was supposed to be the person I trusted most, the one who would help me through this experience and hold space for me, was suddenly dismissive. It made me realize what it truly means to hold space — to give me permission to express any weird thoughts, to cry, laugh, seek nature, love, or feel anxious, stressed, and paranoid.

These people were supposed to help me through this journey, reassuring me, saying, "Hey, we've got you covered. It's fine. That's totally normal. How can we assist you? You want to see your things? That's okay. Of course, you can see your things. Would you feel better if your stuff was next to you in the ceremony room?"

But no, the ceremony master was very blunt. I was like, "Wow, you changed 180 degrees. Why are you so stone-faced right now and so direct?" She replied, "Yes, I am direct. You can't expect us to be there with you all the time." And I'm like, "You should be in there with us, helping us with this experience, and yet here you are eating a white bread Nutella sandwich in a place where you're selling us healing, nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle. What the actual fuck are you doing?"

I was mad and baffled. So I went to get my backpack and came back to the kitchen. She said, "Yeah, go ahead, check your stuff. You're making a fool of yourself. Look at you." She made me feel like I was this pathetic person ruining everybody's experience because I couldn't keep it to myself. 

I looked at my stuff and did feel pathetic. I saw my broken water bottle, the scraps, and the worn-out backpack. Inside, there was a wet swimsuit because I had gone for a swim the day before the retreat and hadn't dried it. I thought, "Wow, this is my life, and it's kind of pathetic." I looked at her and all this and thought about my decisions.

It dawned on me that I had made the wrong decisions. A year ago, I was with the brightest and smartest people on Earth, working on the most important issue of our time. And a year later, I had managed to mess up so massively that I was now stuck in a kitchen with people who had such a small field of vision.

I was still convinced that I could die there or be stuck forever because they had drugged us and would steal all our stuff, and I wouldn't get away. I thought, "Wow, I seriously made the wrong decisions here." At that point, I lost touch with reality, not just somewhat, but a lot.

I was like, "Well, what is real and what isn't? Am I real?" I wanted to see my body, so I took off my pants. I was like, "Do I have legs? What are legs, you know?" And I started touching my legs. I was like, "Okay, those seem real." I spoke to the retreat facilitators while doing this, and they were horrified.

They exclaimed, "Oh my God, what are you doing, Kay? Why are you taking off your pants? You're making a fool of yourself. Look at you." They didn't believe that I was genuinely exploring these insights. They said, "We don't buy it that you're having these insights," while I was genuinely questioning, "Oh, wow. Okay, reality. What is that all about?"

I felt like the moment was infinite, and I was part of this loop where nothing mattered, but not in a bad way—more like an optimistically nihilistic way. I thought, "Oh my gosh, I could die. But really, nothing does matter, right? It's all about decisions, and anything can happen, and that's sort of nice. It gives us a lot of freedom, but ultimately it doesn't matter."

I was testing this hypothesis about the impact of our decisions on reality. At one point, I felt love and thought, "Oh, wow, that's the answer. That's important. If you just want to show me love, then I will go back to the room and enjoy the experience."

So I wanted a hug, but when I looked at the facilitators, they were skeptical, saying, "We don't buy this, Kay." Their faces seemed fake and hostile. I was like, "Wow, this is so bad. It's all about love; you're supposed to share love with me, but you're being mean." It was as if they had never dealt with anyone having a trip before, which was weird because they had plenty of experience.

At that point, I thought, "Okay, I shouldn't be here." One of the caregivers took me by the arm and was a bit forceful, trying to drag me to another room. I told him to stop, saying, "You're out of your bounds here, and you're not supposed to do that. I will call my partner Julita."

They told me that I couldn't call anybody. I was defiant, saying, "I need to make the rules. I will and I can. I can and I will."

They tried to prevent me from calling Julita, but at that moment, I was focused on love. I wanted to spread and share it. The most important person in my life was not there to hear how much I loved her and how dearly I held her in my heart. I insisted that they let me experience and express this.

Eventually, I did call her. I said, "Okay, I'm not doing well here, sweetheart." We ended up having a very long conversation. She stayed on the phone with me for about two hours, recording an hour of it. During this time, I obviously behaved rather oddly. I had long moments of just staring at the ceiling with my mouth closed, having some sort of insight, and then not making much sense while talking.

To a large extent, I had lost touch with what was real. I didn't know what reality was anymore. I didn't know what it meant to be a dad. I was questioning whether anyone could truly be a dad. I thought, "If I'm not with Julita, she won't give birth to anyone because only the things I participate in actually come to fruition."

Then, I noticed a car outside and thought, "It must be the greatest experience on earth to drive a car. Has anybody ever driven a car?" I was fascinated, thinking, "That's what they're selling us in these music videos, right? But they put up all these barriers, like needing a permit to drive. Who has any of this? Do I have a permit? I don't think so. I would love to drive a car. There's a car outside—I could just decide to go out and drive it, right?"

My thoughts continued to spiral. "Flying," I thought, "Flying must be amazing."

I tried to reach out to Julita through my phone and materialize on her side of reality. Needless to say, it didn't work. 


In the kitchen, I finally asked for some water, drank it, and found it refreshing. But then I just wanted to be outside. It was so beautiful—the sky was nice, the sun was shining. Yet, I was tucked away in a room, which didn't feel right. It seemed obvious to me that I should be outside now.

The whole complex was in an industrial setting with small mechanic shops around, not at all like a nice retreat center with plenty of nature, water, and trees like other locations. I just wanted to go out, enjoy a fresh breath of air, and feel healthy.

They told me, "No, you can't go out. We're here for your safety." At that point, I thought, "What do you know about safety? Clearly, you don't know anything." This frustration lasted for a while, but when I finally did get outside, it was beautiful.

<!-- ### I'm MISSING A PART HERE ABOUT MY DAD AND THE SHORT CONVERSATION -->

#### The Ceremony - "Felt" Insights (Part 7)

Despite the paranoia, there were moments of profound insight. I grappled with existential questions and the nature of reality. I felt a strong urge to connect with nature, understand the concept of fearlessness, and embrace love. However, these insights were frequently interrupted by the facilitators’ unsupportive comments and my escalating distrust. The experience was a chaotic mix of profound realizations and deep-seated fears.

I realized that I like language. I like structure. I want to love Julita, my partner. I feel like a failure. My experience should have looked different. I love being sober. Who I spend my time with will determine the quality of my life. I hate rules. I hate people who are incompetent or inactive. Hate is such a strong word. I want to love instead. There was so much rejection today. My dad rejected me. Julita rejected me. The ceremony masters rejected me. Everyone rejected me.

#### Post Ceremony - The Afterglow (Part 1)

As the effects of the psilocybin began to wane, the facilitators finally allowed me to go outside. I was still on the phone with Julita, which was unsettling to the other participants who were also outside. I was asked to end the conversation, which I did reluctantly.

Everyone received hot soup, a bowl full of fruit, and there was plenty of white bread and cheap, industrially manufactured dips from ALDI on the table. As I tried to process the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts from the trip, I experienced a mix of emotions. I felt both very close to the other people around me, intrigued by their uniqueness and the energy they radiated, and alienated from the group. A part of me still believed that we had been drugged and that everyone knew it, but no one seemed to talk about it. 

I initiated a few conversations that went nowhere as the other participants kept their distance. Some of them started talking to one another in Dutch, enjoying a good conversation, but it left me feeling excluded and left to my own devices. 

As I took the time to "just be," everything seemed to glitter in the new light. The first breath of air I took felt sumptuous, full, and revitalizing. It was exactly what I needed. Everything was still moving; wonderful shapes kept forming in the leaves, and the world around me was morphing, alive, and breathing.

I noticed a bike hidden in the leaves that covered the fence and thought it was the most beautiful metaphor for the culture of the Netherlands, a country I had just visited to experience my first psilocybin trip. A country that enables people to have different states of mind, legally. Suddenly, culture seemed of such importance.

I realized that the key driver of my experience was my ego. My inability to trust and let go, or at least my high bar for regaining trust once lost. The thing about me and trust is that I like to extend it in bulk up front, but if you mess it up, it's hard to regain.

<!-- INCLUDE PART ABOUT ROB COMING -->

#### Post Ceremony - The Rejected Apology (Part 2)

That evening, I sought out the ceremony master to apologize for my disruptive behavior during the ceremony. I wanted to reconcile and understand her perspective, hoping it might provide some closure. However, she dismissed me, telling me to wait until the next day. This rejection deepened my feelings of isolation and remorse.

Reflecting on why I felt the need to apologize, I realized I had experienced a profound loss of reality during the ceremony. I didn't trust my own paranoia and my own experience. Even after the effects wore off and I was sober again, part of me wondered if my suspicions had been unwarranted. As I began to see the facilitators as potentially genuine, I felt ashamed for not mustering the courage to trust them during the ceremony. I felt sorry for causing them and the other participants so much trouble.

I had been brutally honest with my criticism, telling them they didn't speak proper English and questioning their competence. Who was I to tell them how to do their job? I wanted to apologize for not extending them the trust that others had managed to do. I realized I had robbed myself of much of the experience by my lack of trust and paranoia, but more importantly, I had caused distress to others.

I wanted to make amends and hear their perspective now that I was sober. However, I was blocked from this reconciliation. At that point, I wasn't sure if my perception of their hostility was accurate or if I had been overly sensitive and overreacted.

To my surprise, Julita had recorded part of our conversation during the ceremony. A few days later, she asked me, "Why were these people so not nice to you?" Her question confirmed that it wasn't just my impression. She described their language as abrasive, even abusive, and their demeanor as nasty.

During a conversation with my coach Adam, he pointed out how difficult it is to discern accountability when in an altered state. He asked if I might have hallucinated aspects of their tone or expressions. I acknowledged that in such a state, sounds, feelings, and sights are different and more intense. I wasn't sure how much I could trust what I had experienced. This uncertainty made me inclined to believe that the facilitators' interpretations were more accurate and that I had been mistaken. 

This insight only reinforced my desire to apologize. I wanted to address any harm I might have caused and understand their perspective. But, being blocked from this attempt left me with unresolved feelings of guilt and confusion.


#### Post Ceremony - The Accepted Apology (Part 3)

<!-- INCLUDE PART ABOUT CONVERSATION WITH JULITA -->

### Day 2 
<!-- The following day, during the reflection session, I apologized to the group for my actions. Some participants accepted my apology, but Jacqueline’s response was particularly harsh. She accused me of psychopathic behaviors and questioned my character in a way that felt both unprofessional and damaging. Her feedback was delivered at a time when I was most vulnerable, compounding the emotional turmoil I was already experiencing. -->

#### Waking up
I'd like to continue with the next day. As I woke up, I wrote the following. 

> A new day has started, and I am the same person. I am ultimately responsible for my life. The decisions I make carry impact. Language is important, and I should think more before I speak. I want to use positive language that invites people to share more of themselves with me. I want to invite humor, laughter, love, and trust. Is my ego too strong? I think this trip showed me that I am too afraid to let go, surrender, and trust. My inner child was trembling. As the mushrooms started acting, I felt an earthquake in my jaw. It was shaking, my jaw, that is. 
 
And then I continued to write what I should change next time: 
> Trust my facilitators more. Use headphones instead of blasting music through speakers. Know the correct dosage. Work with people who are knowledgeable of the science. And get more competent facilitators. Tell people that you don't like authority and that you need reassurance. Get more personal care.


#### Sharing Circle - Shame and Alienation

After a short breakfast, we came together to share our experiences. We gathered in the same room where, a day ago, we had all come together as partly broken people. What did we learn? Who did we become? As part of the ritual, there was a big scepter, and the person holding the scepter was in charge of speaking, invited to share as long as they wanted, as long as they held the scepter. 

<!-- At the end, they would put down the scepter on the floor and say, "Aho." Then, the others would say in unison, "Aho," to affirm that they heard the speaker. And so, here I go. -->

My internal title for this sharing session was "Shame & Reconciliation." I felt ashamed for my behavior during the trip, especially taking out my phone, not following the rules, and potentially making other people's trips less effective. I was seeking reconciliation. I wanted to apologize and be recognized for feeling bad about it and wanting to make amends.

My notebook contains the following notes I took during the session:

> I value truth over conformity. What does respect mean to me? "Me" in underscore. I need to be very careful who I let help me interpret the world. I want to interpret the world myself.

The primary reason for writing this was my belief that the facilitators were not competent enough to help me interpret my world and my experience, although they were trying to do that. This realization was crucial for the next session. I really, really needed to trust these facilitators and know that they were knowledgeable of the science and had more information, more knowledge, and more experience than I did, which wasn't the case now.

I also wrote:
> I need to get back to practicing nonviolent communication.

The second sharing circle was meant to help us process our experiences, but I felt a profound sense of shame and alienation. Other participants shared their transformative journeys, while I was preoccupied with the facilitators' accusations and my own feelings of failure. The sense of community that had been built on the first day felt fractured. It was beautiful to see how 3 of the 10 participants regained a youthful, hopeful spirit after their sessions, but it seemed like the rest of us had hard or unfulfilling trips.

To close off the session, the ceremony master had told the group that we were very impressionable because of the psilocybin. She advised us to avoid large groups, news, and anything stressful, recommending we relax and maybe go for a walk in nature. Yet, shortly after this, she would disregard her own advice and insinuate that there might be something seriously wrong with me.

#### A Final Word - The Accusation: 

You're a Psychopath, Where Were Your Insights? You Owe Your Child. Your Life is So Fucked Up.
#### A Final Word - The Accusation: 

After the sharing session, the ceremony master invited me to a private conversation. I assumed I would be able to apologize and ask her what she thought went wrong. She began by asking if she could be honest with me. I told her she could be brutally honest, valuing constructive feedback. What ensued, however, was an accusation, much more than feedback. Her words were a harsh blow, delivered without the empathy or professionalism I had expected from a retreat leader. This accusation left me questioning not just my behavior during the trip but my overall character and worth—something I wasn't expecting to have to deal with.

She started by saying that I was beyond narcissistic and that I might have psychopathic tendencies, adding that my life was "so fucked up." She suggested I seek psychological help for the sake of my future child. This behavior was unacceptable from a group leader. These people are responsible for helping those on a trip navigate hard times and shape their interpretation of reality.

> "You're a Psychopath, Where Were Your Insights? You Owe Your Child. Your Life is So Fucked Up."

I was in shock. After advising us to avoid negative stimuli because we were impressionable, she gave me this "bad news." Yes, she asked for permission to share her thoughts honestly, and I told her to be brutally honest. But a brutally honest opinion doesn't signify truth and is most definitely not helpful in the aftermath of such an important experience. She could have waited to share her thoughts a week later when everything was settled, but she did not.

She and another facilitator she summoned for the conversation tried to reassure me that it was for my best and that they told me this because they cared for me, not because they hated me. She tried to soften the blow by saying that she wasn't a psychiatrist, yet she followed up by saying she had worked with many criminals with worse illnesses than mine, confirming that she indeed thought I had psychopathic tendencies. To put this into context, she had told the group on the first day that she was a criminal psychiatrist working with criminals. I wasn't sure how that was different from being a regular psychiatrist, but it seemed contradictory.

They tried to muster empathy for me, telling me it must be hard to contain myself in normal life and hide my true face. They were convinced that I use people for my advantage and love to cross their boundaries. They invited me to share what I thought and asked about any insights I had during the trip because they wanted it to be a safe space.

I shared that I appreciated their feedback but that it all came back to some thoughts I had during and after the trip: "Who helps me make sense of reality? Who helps me interpret reality? Most people defer to some sort of experts. Here, we were supposed to defer to you because you've done these sessions and ceremonies quite a lot. But I want to interpret my reality myself because I don't trust your expertise and skill level."

From all I've seen, clearly, you have read even less than I have on this topic. And I’ve only read a book and a half. This is insufficient. You're operating at a very low quality level.

Their reaction was less favorable than their invitation to share my thoughts would have me believe. They told me, "Yeah, well, those are thoughts, not insights. You didn't have any insights." 

I told them, "Well, here's an insight: everyone is selling something and you're not selling it very well." They replied, "Well, I'm not selling anything." I didn't respond, but I thought, "Yes, you are. You're selling healing, emotional relief, one of the most important experiences of your life, and healthy living, and you're not doing it well—see the Nutella white bread."

I left the conversation questioning myself and convinced that what I had experienced was unprofessional. They saw a tiny glimpse of my behavior, which was influenced by 30 grams of truffles and an unpleasant environment, and they had the audacity to make a judgment about my character the size of Mount Everest.

After that, I wrote down three action items:
- I will write a Google review.
- I will meet with a psychologist.
- I will meet with a psychiatrist.


## 5. Post Retreat 
  
### Day 2 - 5: Family, Sports and Journaling

#### Time with Family and Friends 
Returning to my family and friends was both comforting and challenging. I shared my experiences, but the depth of my turmoil was difficult to convey. Their support was unwavering, but I felt a lingering sense of isolation and confusion.

#### Sports (Swim, Bike, Run) 
Engaging in physical activities like swimming, biking, and running became a therapeutic outlet. These activities grounded me and provided a sense of normalcy amidst the emotional chaos.

#### Some Journaling
I journaled extensively, trying to make sense of the experience and its aftermath. Writing allowed me to process my thoughts and emotions, but it was also a reminder of the unresolved questions and lingering doubts.

#### Unfortunately Unhealthy Food 
During this period, my diet slipped into unhealthy patterns. The stress and emotional upheaval made it difficult to maintain healthy eating habits, which only added to my sense of frustration.

#### Could Have Done Less and Shouldn't Have Watched TV 
In hindsight, I realized that I could have benefitted from more rest and solitude. Watching TV and engaging in other distractions prevented me from fully processing the experience and integrating the insights.

#### Should Have Spent More Time by Myself or with Someone Who Understands That I Need Space 
I should have spent more time alone or with someone who understood my need for space and introspection. Being constantly surrounded by people, even those who cared for me, sometimes felt overwhelming and counterproductive.

#### Returning Back Home to Krakow
Returning home marked the end of the retreat but not the end of its impact. The journey back was a time of reflection, trying to piece together the fragments of my experience and understand its implications.

#### Sharing News About Pregnancy with My Family and Friends
Amidst the chaos, there was a moment of joy when I shared the news of the pregnancy with my family and friends. Their happiness and support provided a welcome respite from the turmoil of the retreat.

**Mother**
Sharing my experience with my mother was both

cathartic and challenging. She listened with empathy, and her concern was palpable. Talking to her helped me articulate some of the confusion and fear I had felt during the retreat. Her maternal support provided a sense of comfort and reassurance, even as she struggled to understand the depths of my experience.

**Father**
My conversation with my father was a turning point. His rational and analytical approach helped me dissect the events of the retreat more objectively. He helped me recognize the unprofessionalism and abuse from the facilitators, validating my feelings of mistrust and paranoia. This discussion was instrumental in helping me regain a sense of clarity and perspective.

**Friends**
Sharing with friends provided a mix of reactions, from curiosity to concern. Their varied perspectives helped me see the experience from different angles. Some were intrigued by the idea of a psychedelic journey, while others were worried about the potential psychological impact. These conversations reinforced the importance of a supportive and understanding community when processing such profound experiences.

**Aunt**
My aunt, who had a more spiritual outlook, offered insights that bridged the gap between the mystical and the rational aspects of my journey. She emphasized the importance of integrating the experience into my daily life and finding meaning in the chaos. Her guidance was a soothing counterpoint to the more clinical perspectives I had encountered.


### Days 6 - 12 Post Ceremony Reflections

#### Sharing Ceremony Experiences with
**Partner**
Discussing the retreat with my partner was crucial. She had been my anchor during the experience, especially when I felt lost and paranoid. Her perspective helped me see aspects of the journey I might have missed and provided emotional support as I processed what had happened.

**Coach (Adam)**
Discussing the retreat with my coach, Adam, was a structured and therapeutic process. He helped me break down the experience into manageable parts, reflecting on both the challenges and the insights. His professional approach provided a safe space to explore my emotions and develop strategies for future journeys. His questions and reflections helped me articulate my thoughts more clearly and identify actionable steps for healing and growth.

<!-- What would I change?

Certainly you wouldn't go back to this group, right? So maybe that all by itself is going to have a vastly different outcome, certainly it would.

But it's kind of like imagine what are the actions, what are the productive actions that would emerge from your feeling of guilt and wanting to do something different that you and have the next thing be like, oh, now I don't need to apologize because I didn't do those things anymore.

[@1:16:38](https://fathom.video/share/K-pDagakqs5-WdrdYpcYyvpaC7S6fbg1?timestamp=4598.68) - **Kay Kozaronek (kozaronek@googlemail.com)**

Yeah, first, have a person do the ceremony that I trust more and by trust there are some things like I just need them to be more informed about the substance than I am.

More informed means having more knowledge and having read the research and knowing exact numbers. And just being aware of all of the correct norms that are being proposed by well-class experts like, you know, whatever, Michael Pollum or, or, or, or, what's his name, Knott, Professor David Knott from Imperial College.

And all of the other legendary figures who have preceded these modern like people who have reignited the interest in this, right?

None of these people knew who Stanislav Roth was or any of the other, like, elementary figures in the history of, of these things.

I think at some point they mentioned Maria Sabina, okay, but like, yeah, they had very little sense of cultural and historical, like, edifice in which, in which the experience is embedded.

So that I knew more, which is definitely not the case for my next worry trade, where I will be able to look up to the person that's administering the medicine to me as somebody who is deeply engrossed in all of this and just knows their stuff.

Yeah, so like competency, that's the thing here. And through competency, I can bypass some of the trust building that otherwise would require just like more meetings and more personal contact.

However, like, you know, even if somebody's trust and like through competency, I also think I need more one-on-one sessions with the people that are doing this.

Both prior to the session and then afterwards, I need to be reassured that integration is proper and that preparation is proper.

There are some like the gold standard for this. is like a 13-week type thing where you have like a month of preparation, the ceremonies like the whole thing is five days and then we have another few months of integration.

talked to psychologists also, you really integrate with the group and you build a strong bond between you, medicine in the group, the facilitators, everything, right?

But these experiences cost 6,000 euros or $1, So that's why I didn't opt for them in the first place.

Or if they're short, will be like a stipend that I can apply to, I will do in August and so maybe, who knows?-->

<!-- Summary of Chunk 6
