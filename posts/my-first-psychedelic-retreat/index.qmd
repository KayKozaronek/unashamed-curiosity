# Experience Report

## 1. Encountering "How to Change Your Mind - Michael Pollan"

The journey began long before I booked the retreat or even decided that psychedelics could be a part of my life. It started with a book. Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” found its way into my hands almost serendipitously. Pollan’s meticulous research and eloquent prose about the transformative potential of psychedelics struck a chord with me. His exploration into the science, history, and personal narratives surrounding substances like LSD, psilocybin and mescaline planted a seed of curiosity. Pollan’s balanced approach — acknowledging both the profound insights and the inherent risks — made the idea of a psychedelic journey seem both intriguing and plausible.

## 2. Finding myself in a dark place 
In the months leading up to the retreat, I found myself in a dark place, grappling with a myriad of challenges that piled into an insurmountable mountain of physical and mental stress. My interest in psilocybin began with its medical applications for depression and terminally ill cancer patients. However, I soon wondered if this medicine could help me, an otherwise healthy individual, navigate my own dark night and find daylight.

Professionally, I was grappling with significant uncertainties and doubts about my career path, culminating in a burnout that compelled me to take a week off work and subsequently reduce my working hours for an entire month by 20%. The stagnation in progress at the nonprofit I founded left me feeling unfulfilled and incompetent, constantly questioning whether I was on the right track.

Personally, conflicts among loved ones left me in a constant state of mediation, significantly affecting my well-being. There's nothing more effective at bringing you down than having two of the most significant people in your life fight, lose trust in each other, and break ties, leaving you as the only hair-thin string holding together the massive, bridgeless raft they created. Additionally, I had recently moved to Krakow and didn't have many close in-person friends yet. Although it's easy to make acquaintances, deep friendships take time to develop, and that time simply hadn't passed yet. I was left with barely anyone to talk to.

On top of these professional and personal challenges, I was dealing with a profound sense of disconnection from my community. Before moving to Krakow, I lived in intellectually stimulating environments like London and Berkeley, surrounded by a network of like-minded rationalists, AI Safety researchers, and Effective Altruists. I felt out of sync with the world around me, unable to find a community in Krakow where I truly belonged. This feeling of alienation left me emotionally raw and vulnerable. Previously appreciated behaviors and mental models made turned into weird conversational artfacts that made it difficult to maintain meaningful connections. I was often left feeling isolated and misunderstood.

In addition to these psychological stressors, I had traveled a lot (on average 8 days / month for 6 months) to different time zones and places all the while training for my first marathon. This left me physically challenged, adding additional, self imposed and certainly positive, but draining stressors.

The weight of these issues became almost unbearable. I was constantly anxious and unable to find peace even in moments of quiet. My daily gratitude practice felt like a chore, and monitoring my composure became the only practical way to manage my anger outbursts. Every day felt like a battle against an invisible enemy, leaving me desperate for a way out of the darkness.

This overwhelming confluence of stressors led me to seek a radical solution: psychedelic-assisted therapy. I hoped a psilocybin retreat would provide the clarity, new perspective, and reconnection with myself and the world that I desperately needed. Attending the retreat represented a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak and overwhelming landscape.


## 3. Researching Various Retreats

Inspired by Michael Pollan’s detailed accounts of transformative psychedelic experiences, I embarked on a quest to find a retreat that would align with my personal needs and aspirations. The research process was extensive and demanding. I delved into countless online reviews, talked to 16 different retreat representatives, and scrutinized the qualifications of various facilitators.

My primary criteria included cost and the legal status of the retreat’s location. Secondary considerations were the type of psychedelic medicine used, retreat duration, the earliest available start date, and the rapport I felt with the facilitators. Unfortunately, in my eagerness, I overlooked the critical aspect of professionalism and underestimated how much attention I should have paid to the rapport I felt with the facilitators.

I sought a retreat environment conducive to deep psychological exploration, one that offered robust support and expert guidance to help me navigate the potentially challenging terrains of a psychedelic journey. After carefully weighing all my options, I chose a retreat in the Netherlands that promised a comprehensive approach: some pre-ceremony preparation, a guided psilocybin journey, and a post-ceremony integration sessions. It was a no-frills choice but was reasonably priced at 240 Euros, significantly lower than most other retreats, which started at 1800 Euros.

:::::: {.callout-tip}
# General Purchasing Heuristic
When faced with purchasing decisions for items I'm uncertain about, I typically choose the cheapest option. This approach allows me to test the product and determine if it meets my expectations. I evaluate how frequently I use it and whether it provides the desired value. Often, the inexpensive choice is flawed in some unanticipated ways, quickly revealing if an upgrade is necessary. If I decide to upgrade, I then select the best option available within my budget constraints.  
:::

In all sincerity, I was quite stressed about making the right choice, wary of saving on price at the potential expense of retreat quality. Using my General Purchasing Heuristic didn't seem appropriate for an experience as important as this. What if I would have a bad trip? In addition, I was very nervous about choosing a retreat because I didn’t fully connect with either of the representatives of my final 2 options. Both seemed too “businessy” in their approach, treating me like a customer, which heightened my concerns about their sincerity and professionalism — concerns I should have heeded. 

My partner advised that I might not be ready and suggested waiting before making a decision. Ultimately, I think it's good that I went because postponing it might have led to never going at all. However, she was right about how rushed my final decision felt compared to my research. I spent a few days ruminating before deciding to attend a retreat scheduled for two weeks later. A day after my booking, it turned out that the retreat was already at full capacity, and I was offered a spot one week earlier instead. This left me feeling rushed and robbed of an additional week of mental preparation. These weren’t ideal conditions for retreat preparation, but I went ahead anyway. Soon enough, between booking flights, informing friends and family about my trip, and setting my intentions, the day of the retreat arrived.

## 4. The Retreat

### Day 1  

#### Preparation and Travel 

The day began with a sense of anticipation mixed with anxiety. I made my way to the airport at 03:30 for the early morning flight from Krakow to Amsterdam. In the airport lobby, I found myself revisiting and refining my intentions for the retreat: Clarity, Confidence, and Composure. These "3 C’s" were meant to guide me through the myriad of challenges in my life, from professional uncertainties to personal relationships and a sense of community belonging. I was mentally preparing for what I hoped would be a profound journey.

To arrive at my intention, I wrote out a few things that were on my mind that morning. In the original document, I highlighted the important points. It turned out that professional and AGI-related thoughts were much less pronounced and important during the trip than I had assumed. Here’s what I wrote:

> - How should I prioritize the many challenges in my life?
    - Professional / Work
        - What do I want to work on?
    - Parenthood & my partnership
        - How can I give my child the best life possible?
        - How will our relationship be affected during and after the pregnancy?
        - Do we still want to explore polyamory during or after the pregnancy?
    - Community
        - Krakow, London & Berkeley. Where do I belong?
    - Cognitive dissonance
        - What do I value?
        - What do I want from life?
        - Why am I so obsessed with excellence?
        - Why do I think so poorly of myself?
    - What do I really believe when it comes to AGI?
        - What about timelines?
        - How should my beliefs influence all other decisions I make?
    - Sports / Triathlon & Ironman
        - Do I really want this?
    - Friendships
        - How can I retrain friendships & build new strong connections?
    - Vacation
        - How can I be fine with spending money on leisure?
        - Where do I want to go?
        - How should I define a budget for this?

While writing, I felt that I was lacking clarity in what to prioritize, confidence in my decisions and actions, and the composure necessary to enjoy activities like vacation planning instead of stressing out about them. Voilà, the 3 C’s were synthesized.

#### Arrival

The flight was uneventful, and the ensuing train trip from the airport to the retreat location was calm. I managed to buy a small notebook, a “trip journal”, to accompany me on my trip and started journaling right away.

Upon arrival at the retreat, my initial feelings of anticipation quickly gave way to unease. The facilitators could not specify the exact psilocybin content in the truffles we were to consume. Although they assured us that 30 grams of fresh truffles was an appropriate dose, their lack of detailed knowledge about the psilocybin content raised my skepticism. Knowing that mushrooms typically contain between 0.5% - 2.0% psilocybin, and that a moderate dose for a first-time user is around 1.5 grams, I was alarmed. A ‘heroic dose’ of 5 grams, as termed by Terence McKenna, seemed daunting. Yet, we were assured that 30 grams of truffles would be fine.

:::callout-tip
Terence McKenna (1946-2000) was an American ethnobotanist, mystic, psychonaut, lecturer, and author. He is best known for his advocacy of the use of naturally occurring psychedelic substances, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, and ayahuasca. McKenna's work focused on the potential of these substances to catalyze profound personal and cultural transformation.

One of his notable contributions to psychedelic culture is the concept of the "heroic dose" — a high dose of psilocybin mushrooms, typically around 5 grams, taken in a safe and controlled environment. He believed that such a dose could facilitate deep and transformative experiences, allowing individuals to access the far reaches of their consciousness.
:::

“I took 30 grams last week plus an MAO inhibitor and it was fine,” was one of the facilitator’s responses. Another added, “Don’t worry. You have to think less. You are way too much in your head. Each trip is different. Gender, height, weight, none of it matters because everyone reacts differently.” Another participant, who would later have a panic attack, and I were the only ones who had read up on dosage amounts and expressed concerns. After the retreat, I learned from a Google search that truffles contain between 0.2% and 0.6% psilocybin. The lower potency meant that a larger dosage is required to achieve similar effects as with normal mushrooms. However, without precise information beforehand, I was left to wonder about the potency and safety of what I was about to ingest. This initial uncertainty set a tone of caution and mistrust.

:::callout-tip
MAO inhibitors (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) are a class of drugs that prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their availability. When combined with psilocybin, MAO inhibitors can enhance and prolong the effects by preventing the breakdown of psilocybin into psilocin. This can lead to more intense and longer-lasting trips.
:::
 
#### Sharing Circle (Part 1 - Katharsis & Bonding)

Once all participants arrived, we began the first structured activity: a sharing circle. Each participant and the facilitators were invited to share their backgrounds, the challenges they faced, and their hopes for the retreat. This exercise was designed to foster a sense of community and mutual support. As I listened to others’ stories of struggle and hope, I felt a profound sense of connection and empathy. Hearing the raw, honest experiences of others made me realize I was not alone in my journey.

When my turn came, I opened up about my own life’s challenges. The act of sharing was emotionally overwhelming, and I found myself crying as I spoke. The release felt liberating — a moment of catharsis. This was the first glimmer of the healing I hoped to find at the retreat. Additionally, it was empowering to help others by listening to their stories. We built an initial reservoir of trust within the group. The facilitators did an excellent job of helping us open up and providing the space to express ourselves. The healing properties of hearing and being heard were nothing short of miraculous.

#### The Ceremony (Part 1 - Intention Setting)

With the sharing session complete, we changed into more comfortable clothes and moved into the ceremony room to set our intentions for the psilocybin journey. We sat in front of an altar of candles, each lighting one for ourselves while thanking Mother Earth and expressing our wishes for the journey with the truffles. As each person took their turn, the room filled with a collective sense of purpose. When my turn came, I lit my candle and voiced my hopes for clarity, confidence, and composure.

Once we finished, we took our spots on the mattresses that had been prepared for us. In the “trip journal” I brought for this occasion, I wrote down, “Be brave and heal.” This act of intention-setting felt like a ritual, grounding me in the purpose of the journey ahead. I took a last look at the token I brought with me: a Polaroid of my partner and me on Christmas Eve underneath a mistletoe.

The facilitators then made their rounds through the room, approaching each bed individually to wish each participant a good journey and hand them the medicine. They served the truffles in a small translucent bowl, accompanied by a twig of a needle tree, a small pot of honey, and a menthol candy. As they approached my bed, I felt the massive weight of my life challenges looming over me, and I cracked under their weight, tears the size of grapes rolling down my cheeks. I reminded myself, “Be brave and heal.”

#### The Ceremony (Part 2 - Challenges & Paranoia - Opening my eyes)

The ingestion of the 30 grams of truffles marked the beginning of the journey. These initial stages, before the psilocybin took effect, were characterized by a sense of anticipation and openness. I was ready to embrace whatever insights the experience would bring by consistently asking whatever I experienced: “What are you trying to teach me?”. As the psilocybin started to take effect, I felt a mixture of physical sensations — trembling, tingling, and waves of laughter. 

So far, this sounds like a good trip and it was, but as the trip deepened, the first challenge emerged. The music, a crucial part of the experience, stopped playing twice. I took off my eyeshades, so I was like, okay, what's going on?  

Three facilitators were huddling around the sound system, and they couldn't get it to work. They disrupted the collective journey by incompetence. 

At the same time, the group leader wasn't in the room, somebody went out to get her and then she appeared again.

She was like, okay, this is sort of not good, but you'll figure it out. I'll just play some music on these drums in the meantime.

The soft sound of the steel pan drum was kind of nice. And I was like, okay, fair enough, human mistakes, things happen. I'll turn on my trip again by putting down the eyeshades.

And so I lay down and had a positive experience again. I felt one with the steeely wavy sound from the drums and then they got the music to work again so she stopped playing drums and things just continued to be pleasant for a while. 

But, the music stopped again. At first I reacted laughingly at this because it made like this loud sound when you you remove the aux cable from your phone but as the music was off for longer and loger it made me a bit angry. This technical glitch, coupled with the facilitators’ visible inability to fix it promptly, shattered my sense of safety and trust. I became paranoid and thought: "why don't these people know what they are doing why is this happening? They don't know how to 'hold space'." So I lifted my eyeshade  and I saw that the leader of the group was missing, again.

not there, again, and I was slightly worried. I looked around the room and some of the participants we're like hanging over their buckets, vomiting out, their lungs.

Previously I thought this was extremely hilarious.

But now, it became more concerning to me. Another person was sitting there, she was being paranoid too. A third person started to hold on tight to their pucking bucket. A fourth person was just like crying heavily. All of this was expected from the outset but it became very intense during the trip.

So the team of caregivers were roaming around the room, some of them looked suspiciously at one another and they gavem me suspicious looks too because I looked suspiciously at them. It really wasn't a good atmosphere, I thought.

And at that moment it occurred to me, oh gosh, I made a mistake. I think I took too much and like, what if they drugged us?

Am I having a bad trip? I have to say that they gave us each 30 grams of psilocybin truffles, truffles that contain psilocybin.

My paranoia escalated as I observed other participants in distress—vomiting, experiencing panic attacks, and crying heavily. These reactions, normal under the influence of MAO inhibitors combined with psilocybin, felt alarming while I was under the influence of psilocybin. They intensified my distrust. The atmosphere in the room became tense, and I began to suspect that we were being deceived.

While sitting there it just dawned on me, these people don't know what they're doing. Or worse, they tricked us.

Maybe they're just like very careless in all of what they do, starting from the music, but going on to the the amount of the mushrooms they are giving us. I thought "Why the hell did I do so much research on this and prepare myself so well and then let it all go overboard just because they say oh it's going to be fine and I did 20 of these trust me bro". This wasn't the amount of professionalism I was expecting from people who who were doing this for a living. 

I wrote: 
> How do I know if anything is real? I don't understand any of this. I should be in nature. Am I having a bad trip? 

##### WRITE ABOUT HTE WEIR SCENTED PAPER TOWEL#####

There was a tall, muscular, tattooed facilitator, let's call him "big G" who noticed my distress and he came to try and calm me. I realized that he didn't speak proper English and told him that when he tried to calm me. How can I trust you if we don't speak the same language? And it was enough to communicate, but not like enough to reassure me to give me trust in his competency. 

This was when I got the feeling that I should get up and speak up because I thought we'd gotten drugged. 

There were ten people in the ceremony room, some of which, five I think, took an MAO inhibitor prior to ingesting the truffles, which means that I think three or four people were puking heavily, which is normal and is to be expected, but when I got paranoid, this didn't feel normal at all. I realized this after the music had stopped playing for the first time, and the facilitators were a bit hectic and couldn't quite fix it. Then I realized that another woman was having a panic attack. She didn't breathe properly, and she was anxious about that. A third person was crying heavily and experiencing the trip very heavy, and that was me, who was paranoid.

I was like, oh my God, I think we have been drugged. These people don't know what they're doing. These facilitators just gave us 30 grams of truffles each, which is absurd. And that's when I thought, okay, I think somebody needs to get up. This is the stuff that bad movies are made of, horror movies in fact, and when the survivors at some point later in their life have the courage to speak up, they do so. It's like when a politician or a movie actor are indecent with other people and harass them, and then one person speaks up, and then all of a sudden a whole flood of people speak up.

And then he was like, yeah, it's gonna be fine, don't worry. I was like, okay, I'm here to trust me to let go a will.

And so I lay down, put on my eyeshade again. And music that started playing was just like, I don't know, was very not what I read about that music should be like, you know, like no voices.

This one had voices and it was like a techno type music.
And I was like, well, this is odd, this is making me feel suspicious and paranoid. And I don't like this.

So I was convinced that I wasn't having a bad trip because I was still capable of handling it, so it wasn't super extremely scary, but I was very paranoid and wasn't pleasant. I reminded myself to ask the experience: "What are you trying to teach me"

But at that moment, one of the caregivers had some spray that she sprayed around next to me to give me some sense and flavor the air to make the experience more interesting.

I felt like before I took the eyeshades off,

 -->



<!-- From conversation with Adam 
That's expected, but the way she did it was really weird because what I saw when I took off my eyeshades a few moments earlier was that she was cleaning the bookshelf and she was cleaning it with some sort of spray.

She just sprayed it on top of the tissue she was holding in the air. And then she, she smelled the tissue and looked at her co-workers and just like did a weird, slightly disgusted, but like this, funnily disgusted face, you know.

And to me, this was just absurd. And then she continued cleaning the bookshelf. Um, and it seemed to me like moments later, she was walking around with the same paper towel, which really was just like, a tissue you'd use to wipe your nose with.

She used tit to walk around the room and just like moving it back and forth to spread some scents. It was really bizarre. I mean, I was expecting the facilitators to walk around with  scented candles or burnt herbs and spices but not with cleaning detergent that you think smells weird. Again, I was like: "What's going on here?" 

Another clue that these people have no idea what they're doing and it seemed almost like a circus. It seemed to me like they had just like read about this thing that people want to make these journeys and so they started providing them to others but like it didn't seem like any one of them was at all inspired to do this work by any of the meaningful research that came out that sparked this whole new wave of like psilocybin being an actual like promising cure for depression right and so I found this ridiculous. 

The woman with the scented tissue came closer at some point and I'm like what are you doing you know you have no clue what you're doing.

Another indication was that not everybody was having eye shades and like this is supposed to be the one most important thing besides headphones. And well they didn't have any headphones they played music from like a large box for the entire room. At that point I just looked around okay this is weird this is odd I'm not feeling it I think I'm stuck here, that's bad. Okay, I think I have some willpower I can do stuff I can talk I can move, this is not too bad, I'm like actually quite present. I'm awake so like it's not like I'm drunk and like I can't move my limbs, yes I can't formulate super tight and  bulletproof thoughts, but I know something's wrong here and I think I should speak up and I looked around and everybody was having this bad time. 

I think this is the stuff out of which movies are made of later on when somebody actually puts their experience into writing and then, you know, they make you that Netflix documentary about it, I'm like, oh, and this is how we escaped this like drama and nightmare, a psilocybin trip.

And I thought, okay, but this story always has somebody who at some point speaks up, right?
I think I am that person. Nobody else is going to do it. Look around. so I started saying stuff like, 

> "I have a voice."

It was strictly forbidden to speak during the ceremony. Big G came closer and told me: "Wow, what the hell are you doing, man?"

And instead of what I alluded to earlier "holding space" for me and like helping me make sense of the situation, he tried to put me back on my mattress by touching me on my arms. 

My reaction: "Whoa, don't touch me. In the preparation, you said you would not touch the participants, and yet you're doing it right now. This clearly shows to me that you don't respect your own rules, do you know what you're doing?""

Quickly another piece of evidence popped up. Prior to your retreat, we received an email in which we were told that we shouldn't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes and yet five minutes before the ceremony, they allowed a participant to smoke a cigarette, and I was just like, wow, this is so unprofessional.

I continued to feel justified in my behavior and was like, okay, so this is happening, I do have a voice, let me speak. Big G told me that I can't speak and returned "of course I can". At this point I was convinced they were plotting against us and that they want to steal our stuff while everybody's drugged. I told Big G that I'd like to see my stuff. He couldn't handle the siguation so he called another facilitator that wasn't so involved into all of this. He was an older person whose eyes were  more trust inducing. He told me that I can't speak and that I can't see my stuff. I'm like, well, why not? I was like, oh, well, know, because ceremony, I was like, well, that's not a good reason. You're not explaining it. Well, why on earth can I not see my stuff, right? And I was like, I think I'm going to get up, you know, I want to see my stuff. After multiple request and him going to the kitchen and back where he talked to the ceremony master who, again, wasn't in the room, he told me I could see my stuff.

-->



#### The Ceremony (Part 4 - Eyes wide open) 
I wrote, I remember that they were very abusive when I had my trip. By they I mean the facilitators. There was a tall, muscular, tattooed guy, let's call him "big G", who touched me in an aggressive manner when I was trying to speak up in the ceremony room. The ceremony master, was in the kitchen eating an Nutella white bread sandwich when I needed her. And I, side note, think that this is absurd, because they were selling us healing and good nutrition and good food, and then she was eating the least healthy thing that I could muster. 



So, the thing I wrote after that, when I got up and told them I wanted to see my things, and make sure that they're not trying to rob us, I got up and went to the kitchen, and that's what I wrote there. In the kitchen, they started repeating that I signed a contract, which was totally misplaced. So much for, "holding space". 

Side note, I'm referring here to the common jargon in the psychedelic and other healing practices jargon. Holding space is basically the facilitator's or shaman's responsibility while somebody is on a trip, to give them the room necessary, an emotional room, to express anything that they're feeling, and not to judge them. 

The facilitators at this retreat totally failed me on this, and this is the biggest thing that I think they didn't manage well. The ceremony master, told me that she's "not buying my act", when I was having insights, real insights, in the kitchen. 



> The importance of fearlessness! Be specific. Accept beauty. I want to remember. I want to embrace love. Give me a language for love. Everything has a price. Trust and let go? Many more questions than answers. What are rules? Why am I not supposed to talk? Decisions seem to be everything. I can shape everything. I am ACTION MAN! This is too hectic.

###### WRITE ABOUT THE CAR - PLANE THOUGHTS


I told two of the other facilitators, about a few things that I realized, and honestly, deeply felt. And they told me, in a, what I perceived to be sarcastic, undertone: "Oh wow, how deep, that's a great insight. Go back to the ceremony room, and have some more insights. Go have a journey, you will see. You'll have a journey, it'll be great." It felt like the largest platitude on earth, "Go have a journey!" 

I think I was a tough customer.

I don't think they had ever dealt with somebody like me there, otherwise they would have had more experience and would have helped me cope better and helped me get back to being calm.
In addition, their faces seemed so fake. I tried to analyze their mimicry and asked the facilitators for a hug to grasp their intentions. Upon closer inspection, I couldn't see any genuineness on their face. I would have gotten back to my bed if I did see a genuine smile. I felt like they trapped me in this goddamn house, trying to rob me of the life I still had ahead of me. This felt especially bad in connection with the "You signed a contract, you took the 30 grams of mushrooms" type thing. Especially because the contract was also not very professionally designed, and they initially didn't have enough contracts in English, which meant that I nearly ended up signing a contract that was in Dutch.

<!-- Conversation with Adam

And he's like, oh, well, whatever. So I left the ceremony room and leaving the ceremony room room would get into the kitchen, right?

This is like the next room. And there was the ceremony leader, right? She looked at me and she was like, oh, gosh, you want to get your stuff?

Yeah, sure. I was shocked. Wow. Moments prior, right? an hour and a half ago, I was was I was pouring out my heart to these people, telling them about my story and about all of the things that happened to me, where I am in life and what problems I'm facing.

I cried out. I had this cathartic moment where sharing all of this was wonderful and just being heard and the group was really healing already before the whole ceremony started.

then when they gave me the mushrooms and wish me farewell, I also cried because I couldn't contain myself that I was there brave enough to go on this journey and to seal.

And here we are an hour later, an hour and half in a way that like, it hit me right in the face.

was like, wow. She's supposed to be the person that I give the most trust here and that helps me through this whole experience, that holds space and all of a sudden makes sense to me what it means to hold space, right?

To give me all the permission I have to like express whatever weird thoughts I have, what I'm crying, laughing, whether I express the need to see nature, whether I want to love, whether I'm anxious and like stressed and paranoid, you know?

And these people are supposed to be there to help me through and be like, hey, you've got you covered.

It's fine. That's totally normal. How can we be of assistance or you want to see your things? That's okay.

Of course you can see your things, Kai. Let me help you. What did you feel better if your stuff was next to you in the ceremony room?

Good. That's right. had to expect it. And she was very brush. was like, wow you changed the meter like 180 degrees why are you so so stone face right now and so direct right and she's like yes I am direct and I'm like you should be in there with us helping us with this experience and yet here you are eating a white bread Nutella sandwich you know at a place where you're selling us healing and and and nutrition and you know like a healthy lifestyle what the actual  are you doing and like I was mad you know wow no not as much as I'm expressing it right now but I was just baffled you know and so I went to bet my backpack came back to the kitchen and she's like yeah go ahead check your stuff you're making

full of yourself look at you very like just me and and and you know interpreting the whole thing as like me being this pathetic like person ruining everybody's experience because I can't keep it to myself and then I looked at my stuff and I did feel pathetic I was like oh wow this is my life a water bottle that is broken you know there's like on the outside and scraps and whatever the backpack is also not in its best shape you know you'll see that it's used there's a wet swimming pan image which which is still wet because the day prior to to the retreat I went for swim and I couldn't dry it that took it with me and just like you know I was like wow this is my life you know that's kind of pathetic and so I looked at her and then all this and I was like wow felt about decisions and we thought

on me, like I made the wrong decisions. A year ago, I was with the brightest and smartest people on Earth working on the most important issue of our time.

And a year later, I managed to like,  up so massively. And I'm stuck in a kitchen with people that have such a small field of vision and such.

And you know, I was still convinced that I would die there or whatever, it could be stuck there forever, because they have drug does and would steal all of our stuff and I wouldn't get away.

I was just like, wow, seriously made the wrong decisions here. Yeah, and then at that point, I lost some touch with reality, like not somewhat like a lot.

was like, well, is real and what isn't? know, yeah, am I real, you know? I wanted to see my body.

So I took off my pants. I was like, well, do I have legs? Like, what are legs, you know?

And I started touching my legs. I was like, okay, those seem real. And I spoke to them while doing it.

And you're like, Oh, my God, what are you doing, Kai? And why are you taking off your pants? You're making a fool of yourself.

Like, look at you. And they said, you know, oh, we don't buy it that you're having these insights where, you know, whereas I was really just like, Oh, wow.

Okay, reality. What is that all about? I felt like the moment was infinite. And sort of, I was part of this loop, like nothing mattered, but not in a bad way, not nihilistically, like, Oh, my gosh, I could die.

But like, Oh, nothing does really matter, right? It is all about decisions. And everything can happen. And that's sort of nice.

And we're shoring and gives us a lot of freedom. But it ultimately doesn't matter, right? And so I was trying to test this hypothesis of like, okay, what can our decisions make off the reality that we do in habit?

And at one point I felt like, love, oh, wow, that's the answer, that's important. Oh, if you just wanna show me love, then I will go back to room and enjoy the thing.

So I wanted a hug and then I looked at these people and was like, do I really buy this, right?

looked at the faces and I all see it's so fake. I was like, wow, this is so bad, you know?

It's all about love, you're supposed to me love, right? And they like, oh, we're not buying a car, you know, whatever.

As if they had never dealt with anybody who's having a trip, which is weird because they have plenty of times.

Yeah, like so short, I was like, okay, I think I'm not being. here. One of the caregivers also took me by the arm and was a bit more physical and wanted to drag me to another room and said, stop this.

You're out of your bonds here and you're not supposed to do that. I will call you Lita. You're like, no, no, you're not calling anybody.

I was like, , I need to make the rules. I will and I can. I can and I will.

And so they were trying to like not have me call you Lita.

And at that moment, I was like, all about love.


If you're again, mean, like, I want to spread it and share it. And like, the most important person my life is not here to listen to how much and dearly I hold her and how much I love her.

But the , you know, you should let me experience, express this. And so I did call her eventually. I was like, okay, I'm not doing well here, whatever.

We ended up having a. very long conversation. She stayed up with me for like two hours on the phone.

And she did record an hour of it. I was obviously behaving rather oddly and had long moments of just staring at the ceiling with my mouth closed and having some sort of insight and then not making much sense while talking.

But then I wrote some of it down in my book, in my notebook. Yeah, and then in the experience for off.

And I got outside and everything was new and nice, fresh lights. Well, while I was in the kitchen, I was still I realized that these people are kind of unhealthy and like everything like, you know, table was dirty.

And I was like, what's going on? And I couldn't quite comprehend why it was like that. I really wanted to go into nature, like a hallmark of the experience that most people have.

in common. And I was in the kitchen, I was like, well, can I have some water and I drink some water and like, that's refreshing.

But then I just wanted to be outside, you know, and this was like so beautiful. And this guy was really nice and it was sun.

And yet I was in the in the room somewhere tucked away. And that didn't feel right. And to me, it was the most obvious thing to just be outside now, right?

And this whole complex you have to know is like in an industrial setting where there was like a bunch of like small mechanic shops around like, you know, not at all in like some nice retreat house and center with like plenty of nature and maybe some water and like trees and stuff unlike other other locations.

And so yeah, was just like, oh, I would like to go out and like just enjoy a fresh breath of air and feel, feel healthy, you know.

and they were like, no, you can't cry all the time. know, we're here for your safety. And at that point, was like, what do you know about safety, right?

clearly, you don't know anything. And yeah, this lasted then for like, once in a time, and in the end, when I did get out, was beautiful.

to a large extent, I had like a loss of what is real.

didn't know what is real. I didn't know what it means to be a dad. didn't like, I was questioning whether anybody at all is a dad.

I was like, Oh, if I'm not with you, like, clearly she will not give birth to anybody because like only the things that I participate in will actually counter fruition.

And, oh, wow, there's a car outside, like what it must be the greatest experience on earth to like. drive a  car like has anybody ever driven a car?

Oh, that's what they're selling us in these like music videos, right? Wow. But they're putting up all these barriers.

Like, you have to get a permit to drive a car. Who's got any of this? Like, do I have a permit?

I don't think so. I would love to drive a car. But it's a car outside. I could just decide to go out and like drive the car, right?

Oh, wow. Flying. Flying must be amazing.

#### The Ceremony (Part 5 - "Felt" Insights)

Despite the paranoia, there were moments of profound insight. I grappled with existential questions and the nature of reality. I felt a strong urge to connect with nature, to understand the concept of fearlessness, and to embrace love. However, these insights were frequently interrupted by the facilitators’ incompetence and my escalating distrust. The experience was a chaotic mix of profound realizations and deep-seated fears.

 I realized that I like language. I like structure. I want to love Yulita, my partner. I feel like a failure. My experience should have looked different. I love being sober. Who I spend my time with will determine the quality of my life. I hate rules. I hate people who are incompetent or inactive. Hate is such a strong word. I want to love instead. There was so much rejection today. My dad rejected me. Yulita rejected me. The ceremony masters rejected me. Everyone rejected me.

#### Post Ceremony (Part 1 - The Afterglow)

<!-- Conversation with Adam 

Everything seemed to be glitter in the new light. first breath of the air I took was the most, you know, it felt so subtuous.

Like, it was full, and yet revitalizing was like fresh. It was just what I needed. Everything was still like kind of moving in shapes for like more thing and bit.

So that was still very nice.

But yeah, that's just, that's how the experience went on, mostly focusing on, you know, the things that they did not manage well.

But yeah, I think the key driver of this was just my ego and my inability to trust, or at least my high bar for creating and generating trust.
 -->

As the effects of the psilocybin began to wane, there was a brief period of calm and reflection. I tried to process the whirlwind of emotions and insights from the trip. The facilitators encouraged us to share our immediate feelings, but my distrust had not abated. I felt alienated from the group and skeptical of the facilitators’ ability to provide genuine support.

#### Post Ceremony (Part 2 - The Rejected Apology)

That evening, I sought out Jacqueline to apologize for my disruptive behavior during the ceremony. I wanted to reconcile and understand her perspective, hoping it might provide some closure. However, Jacqueline dismissed me, telling me to wait until the next day. This rejection deepened my feelings of isolation and remorse.

<!-- Adam
So, okay, so so that was like loss of reality, right? And I didn't know what was real and what wasn't.

And so I did. I did. I didn't trust my own paranoia. And on my own experience, I was like, still under the impression that I had been

hey very poorly and you know after coming out of out on the other hand just being sober again I was like ah this is nice you know I'm I'm here nothing did happen they did let us out there are normal people and I can leave this place some amount of my paranoia actually manifested and so I was like okay so maybe perhaps they weren't as bad to me as I thought right maybe they were genuine and I was just like not able to see that and so I felt incredibly sorry for that because I was like well I was ashamed that I didn't muster the courage to trust them enough with this and that I did cause them so much trouble with me and the other participants because I was sure that they must have been disturbed by me acting out

And, well, I was blue, the honest with them, with my criticism, right? So, like, that's at the very least something to apologize for, right?

hey, you're telling somebody that they don't speak properly English and, like, telling them that they should be doing some, their work differently, know, some models for lack of other words.

Like, it's like, how do you say this? Who am I to tell them how to do that job, right?

that's something to apologize for. Yeah, and for not extending them, the trust that the others were perfectly capable of doing.

Yeah, yeah, that's what I did want to apologize for. Yeah, I did rob myself of most of the experience, right?

as I already said, but I, I mean, I was totally beside the point, it wasn't about me, it was about the others and about them and me causing them some distress.

And that's really what I wanted to, to make amends with whatever that I wanted to make peace with. And just also hear from their perspective now that I was sober again, how they experienced all that.

But I was blocked Yeah. And at that, at that point, I didn't know whether I was right in assuming that they were not nice to me.

For all I knew, I could have just been too sensitive to that and like overreacting. But to my surprise, Lita did, you know, record our conversation half of it.

And without me asking her, she was just like a day or a few days later, hey, like, why were these people so not nice to you?

And I was like, oh, it wasn't just my impression? She's like, no, I mean, they were very abrasive, abusive, whatever, in their language.

And they sounded very nasty.

 see. Okay. Yeah, it seems uniquely difficult to understand the specific things that you feel, you know, you could be sort of like accountable for or responsible for when you're in an altered state, you know, your perceptions, know, the fact you have this other objective data, I think, is fascinating.

You know, you wouldn't have had that. You know, one of my questions is going to be like, is there any chance you could have almost like hallucinated certain aspects of their tone of voice or their facial expressions, like, or that just went into your brain and your brain just like, put it into this like really negative kind of processing where just like the reality was that that wasn't that way.

Did you think that there could be some chance of that?

[@1:14:56](https://fathom.video/share/K-pDagakqs5-WdrdYpcYyvpaC7S6fbg1?timestamp=4496.48) - **Kay Kozaronek (kozaronek@googlemail.com)**

Yeah, obviously, like, I knew very well that I'm an state of mind, sounds are different, feelings are different, you know, sights are different, like everything is just more fit a bit, some things are more more, some things are more blessed, and you know, I wasn't quite sure how much I can trust what I did experienced and sensed.

And so I was airing on like the side of them being sober and them having, you know, a quote unquote proper interpretation of the events and me being mistaken, right?

And so that just put me in position where I was like, hey, I think I want to apologize, you know?
 -->

#### Post Ceremony (Part 3 - The Accepted Apology)

The following day, during the reflection session, I apologized to the group for my actions. Some participants accepted my apology, but Jacqueline’s response was particularly harsh. She accused me of psychopathic behaviors and questioned my character in a way that felt both unprofessional and damaging. Her feedback was delivered at a time when I was most vulnerable, compounding the emotional turmoil I was already experiencing.

### Day 2 

#### Waking up
I'd like to continue with the next day. As I woke up, I wrote the following. A new day has started, and I am the same person. I am ultimately responsible for my life. The decisions I make carry impact. Language is important, and I should think more before I speak. I want to use positive language that invites people to share more of themselves with me. I want to invite humor, laughter, love, and trust. Is my ego too strong? I think this trip showed me that I am too afraid to let go, surrender, and trust. My inner child was trembling. As the mushrooms started acting, I felt an earthquake in my jaw. It was shaking, my jaw, that is. And then I wrote, what should I change next time? Trust my facilitators more. Use headphones instead of blasting music through speakers. Know the correct dosage. Work with people who are knowledgeable of the science. And get more competent facilitators. Tell people that you don't like authority and that you need reassurance. Get more personal care.



#### Sharing Circle (Part 2 - Shame and Alienation)

<!-- Adam

On the same day, was like, while I was coming down, I wanted to, we'd be set together and we wanted to talk a bit.

I felt very, very alienated from the group, and I felt remorse because of my behavior, because of attracting so much attention from the caregivers that, you know, they had to be there with me rather than being with the other participants.

And I wanted to apologize. I did try that with the group leader, and she denied me. I was like, hey, do you have a moment?

I'd like to apologize. she was like, no, you can speak to me tomorrow. I felt really bad.

No, she's told the entire group that we are very impressionable right now because we just took some of the side of the day before.

Or I slept. Please do not go out to watch groups of people and do not consume any news, do not consume any bad things, just chill on the couch at home, that's most you should do, maybe go out for a walk, interest in nature, but stay away from these things.

Also don't smoke any pop up because of the throw you right back into the experience and make you trip hard and then nobody will be there to guide you and help.

So don't do that. And then five minutes, ten, fifteen minutes later when we had a conversation, the solo conversation, her and I and another one of the retreat helpers, said that I might be a psychopath.

 -->

Okay, I'd like to continue with the sharing section of the retreat. So, on the second day, we came together and we shared our experiences. Everybody got like a scepter, a big scepter, and the person holding the scepter was in charge of speaking and invited to share as long as they wanted, as long as they held the scepter. And then at the end, they would put down the scepter on the floor and say, Aho. And then the others would say in collaborative voice, Aho, to affirm that they heard the other person. And so, here I go. Shame. Reconciliation. Side note, I mean here that I felt ashamed for how I was behaving during the trip, especially taking out my phone and not following the rules and potentially making other people's trips less effective. And I was seeking for reconciliation. I wanted to apologize and be recognized for feeling bad about it and wanting to make amends. Back to the text. I value truth over conformity. What does respect mean to me? Me in underscore. I need to be very careful who I let help me interpret the world. I want to interpret the world myself. And here, side note, I thought that facilitators were not competent enough to help me interpret my world and my experience, although they were trying to do that. And this is really important for the next session. I really, really, really need to trust these facilitators and know that they are knowledgeable of the science and that they have more information at their disposal, more knowledge, more experience than I do, which wasn't the case now. During the session, they also told us that there is a website, futureme.org. Then I wrote, I need to get back to NVC. By this, I mean nonviolent communication. Then they told us about being able to bring in another person and travel for free or help guide them. I had serious doubts about my ability or other people's ability or not trained and knowledgeable to guide such important experiences. And this just speaks to their non-professionalism. However, back to the text, I wrote, how can I guide? Is this a good idea at all?

The second sharing circle was meant to help us process our experiences, but I felt a profound sense of shame and alienation. Other participants shared their transformative insights, while I was preoccupied with the facilitators' accusations and my own feelings of failure. The sense of community that had been built on the first day felt fractured.

#### The Accusation: You're a Psychopath, Where Were Your Insights? You Owe Your Child. Your Life is So Fucked Up.

<!-- Adam 
And she said that she thinks I have psychopathic behaviors. And she's worked with many criminals in her life that have worse illnesses than I, confirming that she thinks I do have that, and I might be a psychopath, or at least a very strong narcissist, that I use people.

that I would love to break their boundaries and that it must be hard for me to contain myself within my normal life and hide my true faith.

And you know she was all saying that under the pretext of like oh we all want the best for you and we like you so very much and like don't worry about it you know maybe I'm wrong you should talk to a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

But also you know she was saying because I'm not a psychiatrist which is kind of weird because she did tell us that she was a criminal psychiatrist like working with criminals and like I'm not sure where the difference in that is but like yeah she was saying oh this is not a diagnosis talk to some of the professionals who want the best for you but like you know you should live into this.

how much, who helps me make sense of reality, who helps me interpret reality, right? Most people just tend to, you know, defer to some sort of experts.

And here, you know, we were supposed to defer to them because they have done these sessions and ceremonies quite a lot and whatever.

I was like, well, but I want to interpret my reality myself because I don't trust your expertise and skill level.

Clearly, you have read even less than I have on this topic. And I, you know, I've just read book and a half.

like what the F, this is insufficient. You're operating at like a very low quality level. Anyway, yeah, she told me this and I was like, okay, yeah, but this backs the question, the same question about like who interprets your reality, especially when it comes to things like this, right?

Like if you talk about math. You know, you can tell me one plus one equals two and then postulate some extremes and whatever and teach me how to use your math language and then, you know, we can agree on stuff.

But here, it's like, you know, you saw a tiny glimpse of my behavior, which was influenced by 30 grams of truffles and, you know, a rather unpleasant environment.

And you were making a job and about my character and the contents of it. This is like, mean, you wouldn't say, oh, gosh, know, Greg is a beast because, you know, once he was drunk, once he was drunk and, you know, he put down his pants and, like, Pete on the side of the street, he's the worst person to learn for something, right?

And yet she was doing something very analogous and all of that while being very explicit about avoiding that news, avoiding watching any television and like going to large crowds where lots of people are and where lots of stimuli are and telling the whole group that just that 15 minutes prior to conversation, know, hey, before warms do not do these things you're very, very impressionable.

And then, you know, she did pull the trigger on me, like, oh, you might be a psychopath, go check.
 -->

During a private conversation, Jacqueline told me that she believed I had psychopathic tendencies and that my life was "so fucked up." She suggested I seek psychological help for the sake of my future child. Her words were a harsh blow, delivered without the empathy or professionalism I had expected from a retreat leader. This accusation left me questioning not just my behavior during the trip but my overall character and worth.

Okay, the next thing I wrote is the following. The worst thing is that Jacqueline told me that she thinks I'm beyond narcissistic, and that I might be a psychopath in underscores. This happened on the day after the retreat. Quick side note. I did ask her to apologize on the day of the retreat, in the evening, when I got sober, because I felt like I wanted to clear the air, and she refused to talk to me. She said, no, we'll talk tomorrow. This felt very bad, felt very rejected, and was the opposite of inclusion. She was just very ill-suited to do this whole thing. Anyway, back to the text. This is unacceptable behavior from a shaman-slash-group-leader. These people are responsible for helping us, the people who journey, navigate these hard times, and they are responsible for shaping our interpretation of reality. Here, I underscored interpretation of reality. This is particularly crucial after the trip, when we are super susceptible, as Jacqueline also pointed out, just minutes prior to this conversation. It's especially important to get this right when we are so vulnerable and impressionable. During the sharing and integration on the day after the ceremony, just minutes prior to the conversation I had with her and another facilitator in private, where she told me that I would be a narcissist, she told us to avoid the bad news, or any news on the TV whatsoever, and other bad stimuli. I am in shock that after telling us to do that, she gave me these bad news. Yes, she did ask me for permission to share her thoughts with me, honestly, and I did tell her to be brutally honest, but a brutally honest expression of an opinion doesn't signify truth, and is most definitely not helpful in the aftermath of such an important experience. She could have waited with sending me information and her thoughts about this a week later, when everything was fine, but she did not. Back to the text. She could have waited and told me a week later. They tried to reassure me that it is for my best, and that I owe it to my future child. By they I mean Jacqueline and the other facilitator when they delivered the news. They told me I need help, because my life is so fucked up in Underscore. They used these words literally. They asked me if I want to hear the truth, and I told them to be very honest, but an honestly expressed thought or opinion does not equal truth. And then after that I wrote down three action items. I will write a Google review. I will meet with a psychologist, and I will meet with a psychiatrist.



## 5. Post Retreat 
  
### Day 2 - 5: Family, Sports and Journaling

#### Time with Family and Friends 
Returning to my family and friends was both comforting and challenging. I shared my experiences, but the depth of my turmoil was difficult to convey. Their support was unwavering, but I felt a lingering sense of isolation and confusion.

#### Sports (Swim, Bike, Run) 
Engaging in physical activities like swimming, biking, and running became a therapeutic outlet. These activities grounded me and provided a sense of normalcy amidst the emotional chaos.

#### Some Journaling
I journaled extensively, trying to make sense of the experience and its aftermath. Writing allowed me to process my thoughts and emotions, but it was also a reminder of the unresolved questions and lingering doubts.

#### Unfortunately Unhealthy Food 
During this period, my diet slipped into unhealthy patterns. The stress and emotional upheaval made it difficult to maintain healthy eating habits, which only added to my sense of frustration.

#### Could Have Done Less and Shouldn't Have Watched TV 
In hindsight, I realized that I could have benefitted from more rest and solitude. Watching TV and engaging in other distractions prevented me from fully processing the experience and integrating the insights.

#### Should Have Spent More Time by Myself or with Someone Who Understands That I Need Space 
I should have spent more time alone or with someone who understood my need for space and introspection. Being constantly surrounded by people, even those who cared for me, sometimes felt overwhelming and counterproductive.

#### Returning Back Home to Krakow
Returning home marked the end of the retreat but not the end of its impact. The journey back was a time of reflection, trying to piece together the fragments of my experience and understand its implications.

#### Sharing News About Pregnancy with My Family and Friends
Amidst the chaos, there was a moment of joy when I shared the news of the pregnancy with my family and friends. Their happiness and support provided a welcome respite from the turmoil of the retreat.

**Mother**
Sharing my experience with my mother was both

cathartic and challenging. She listened with empathy, and her concern was palpable. Talking to her helped me articulate some of the confusion and fear I had felt during the retreat. Her maternal support provided a sense of comfort and reassurance, even as she struggled to understand the depths of my experience.

**Father**
My conversation with my father was a turning point. His rational and analytical approach helped me dissect the events of the retreat more objectively. He helped me recognize the unprofessionalism and abuse from the facilitators, validating my feelings of mistrust and paranoia. This discussion was instrumental in helping me regain a sense of clarity and perspective.

**Friends**
Sharing with friends provided a mix of reactions, from curiosity to concern. Their varied perspectives helped me see the experience from different angles. Some were intrigued by the idea of a psychedelic journey, while others were worried about the potential psychological impact. These conversations reinforced the importance of a supportive and understanding community when processing such profound experiences.

**Aunt**
My aunt, who had a more spiritual outlook, offered insights that bridged the gap between the mystical and the rational aspects of my journey. She emphasized the importance of integrating the experience into my daily life and finding meaning in the chaos. Her guidance was a soothing counterpoint to the more clinical perspectives I had encountered.


### Days 6 - 12 Post Ceremony Reflections

#### Sharing Ceremony Experiences with
**Partner**
Discussing the retreat with my partner was crucial. She had been my anchor during the experience, especially when I felt lost and paranoid. Her perspective helped me see aspects of the journey I might have missed and provided emotional support as I processed what had happened.

**Coach (Adam)**
Discussing the retreat with my coach, Adam, was a structured and therapeutic process. He helped me break down the experience into manageable parts, reflecting on both the challenges and the insights. His professional approach provided a safe space to explore my emotions and develop strategies for future journeys. His questions and reflections helped me articulate my thoughts more clearly and identify actionable steps for healing and growth.

<!-- What would I change?

Certainly you wouldn't go back to this group, right? So maybe that all by itself is going to have a vastly different outcome, certainly it would.

But it's kind of like imagine what are the actions, what are the productive actions that would emerge from your feeling of guilt and wanting to do something different that you and have the next thing be like, oh, now I don't need to apologize because I didn't do those things anymore.

[@1:16:38](https://fathom.video/share/K-pDagakqs5-WdrdYpcYyvpaC7S6fbg1?timestamp=4598.68) - **Kay Kozaronek (kozaronek@googlemail.com)**

Yeah, first, have a person do the ceremony that I trust more and by trust there are some things like I just need them to be more informed about the substance than I am.

More informed means having more knowledge and having read the research and knowing exact numbers. And just being aware of all of the correct norms that are being proposed by well-class experts like, you know, whatever, Michael Pollum or, or, or, or, what's his name, Knott, Professor David Knott from Imperial College.

And all of the other legendary figures who have preceded these modern like people who have reignited the interest in this, right?

None of these people knew who Stanislav Roth was or any of the other, like, elementary figures in the history of, of these things.

I think at some point they mentioned Maria Sabina, okay, but like, yeah, they had very little sense of cultural and historical, like, edifice in which, in which the experience is embedded.

So that I knew more, which is definitely not the case for my next worry trade, where I will be able to look up to the person that's administering the medicine to me as somebody who is deeply engrossed in all of this and just knows their stuff.

Yeah, so like competency, that's the thing here. And through competency, I can bypass some of the trust building that otherwise would require just like more meetings and more personal contact.

However, like, you know, even if somebody's trust and like through competency, I also think I need more one-on-one sessions with the people that are doing this.

Both prior to the session and then afterwards, I need to be reassured that integration is proper and that preparation is proper.

There are some like the gold standard for this. is like a 13-week type thing where you have like a month of preparation, the ceremonies like the whole thing is five days and then we have another few months of integration.

talked to psychologists also, you really integrate with the group and you build a strong bond between you, medicine in the group, the facilitators, everything, right?

But these experiences cost 6,000 euros or $1, So that's why I didn't opt for them in the first place.

Or if they're short, will be like a stipend that I can apply to, I will do in August and so maybe, who knows?-->

<!-- Summary of Chunk 6 

### Chunk 6 Summary

#### Reflections and Lessons Learned
- **Set and Setting**: Kay emphasizes the importance of a proper mindset and environment for a psilocybin experience. He acknowledges that he lost focus and deviated from his intended mindset during the retreat, which contributed to the negative outcome.
- **Improvements for Future Experiences**: Kay plans to bring better eye shades and use headphones to ensure a consistent and personal music experience. He also highlights the importance of knowing the exact dosage of psilocybin and having a checklist to ensure everything is properly prepared.
- **Communication and Trust**: For future trips, Kay intends to communicate his concerns clearly and ensure that facilitators address them adequately. He recognizes the need for more one-on-one sessions with facilitators before and after the ceremony to build trust and ensure proper integration.
- **Self-Trust and Preparedness**: Kay mentions creating a written guide or checklist for himself to follow during the trip, which can help him manage his experience if things go wrong. This includes reassuring himself about reality and reminding himself to trust his own judgment.
- **Validation from Partner**: Julita’s validation of Kay’s experience helped him feel less isolated and confirmed that the facilitators' behavior was inappropriate and unprofessional.

#### Processing Negative Feedback
- **Handling Criticism**: Kay discusses the feedback from the group leader, who suggested he might have psychopathic tendencies. He acknowledges that talking about it with others has helped him process the criticism and gain perspective.
- **Empathy and Normalcy**: Conversations with friends and Julita reassured Kay that he is empathetic and normal, despite the harsh feedback from the group leader. This has helped him feel less affected by the negative comments.
