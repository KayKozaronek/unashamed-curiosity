Aren't we all dreaming of assembling a team where each member is not just competent but truly exceptional? 'A players' - top-tier talents who drive innovation and excellence - form the backbone of high-performing teams. However, identifying these individuals is challenging. This essay explores strategies to identify A players by leveraging smart deference, effectively narrowing the search space while reducing hiring mistakes.


## Challenges in Identifying A Players

Recruiting A players might seem daunting at first. The primary challenges include:

1. **Large Search Space:** A players make up only a small proportion of the total talent pool.
2. **Limited Resources:** Time and money constraints limit the search.
3. **High Cost of Mistakes:** Hiring mistakes, such as false positives, lead to high churn or team quality degradation, while false negatives waste valuable resources.

## Smart Deference Strategies

To overcome these challenges, we can use proxies to narrow our search:

### Proxy 1: The Top is Usually Highlighted

Paradoxically, it is probably easier to find an A* player than an A or B player. This is due to the power law distribution of talent and achievement, where the higher you get to the top of any field, the less crowded it usually becomes.

**Action: Defer to the Top**

- **Identify the Top Contributors:** Start by identifying the most important contributors in a field.
- **Prioritize Effort:** Only move to the next rank if no progress is made with the top candidates after considerable effort.

### Proxy 2: A Players Surround Themselves with Other A Players

A players tend to associate with other A players. Identify one noed to tap into their network of excellence.

**Action: Defer to Other A Players**

- **Identify a Key A Player:** Find at least one person who exhibits the desired qualities, ideally someone you already know.
- **Ask for References:** Request references and build relationships with these individuals.
- **Repeat the Process:** Habitually ask, “Who is the most impressive person you know who does X, and why?” and seek introductions.

### Proxy 3: A Players Work on Impressive Projects

A players are often involved in high-impact projects that exemplify the quality of work you seek.

**Action: Defer to Impressive Projects**

- **Identify Exemplary Projects:** Find projects that reflect the quality of work you desire.
- **Contact Key Contributors:** Reach out to the individuals responsible for these projects, such as first authors on scientific papers or engineering leads behind notable products.
- **Leverage Your Network:** Ask existing A players to help identify impressive projects.

### Proxy 4: A Players are Entrepreneurial

Although entrepreneurial individuals exist in large organizations, they are often harder to identify due to internal hurdles. In contrast, their contributions are more visible in smaller companies.

**Action: Defer to Small High-Performance Companies**

- **Identify Traction-Driven Startups or Nonprofits :** Look for startups with traction, but avoid being swayed by hype.
- **Reach Out to Key Players:** Contact individuals working in these startups, usually less than 15 people.


To conclude, constrain your search space for A players by deferring to the top, other A players, impressive projects, and small high-performance companies. This strategy aims to reduce false positives, decreasing the pool of potential candidates while enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the hiring process.
