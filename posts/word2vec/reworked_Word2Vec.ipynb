    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is one of the most well-known word embedding algorithms. Although it has been succeeded in efficacy by more recent transformer-based algorithms like BERT and GPT, Word2Vec remains a valuable algorithm to understand. It was the first algorithm to produce word embeddings that captured both syntactic and semantic relationships between words, famously demonstrated by the \"king - man + woman = queen\" analogy. This made a profound contribution to natural language processing and kicked off a swath of impressive developments. In this post, we will take a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of Word2Vec. But before we do that, let's first review why word embeddings are crucial for NLP tasks."

    "**Word embeddings** (also called as vectors, representations) **are high-dimensional** (usually 50-1000 dimensions) **dense vectors** over which you can do all kinds of arithmetics and most importantly encode similarity. Arithmetics like the notories example \"king–man+woman=queen\" or \"good-best+bad=worst\". These two examples illustrate how semantic (meaning) and syntactic (grammar) similarities are encoded in the word vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of word embeddings is based on distributional semantics which is the concept of representing a word based on its usual context. This idea waw popularized by a linguist, J. R. Firth, with his famous quote \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" in the 1950s. [\"The basic idea of distributional semantics can be summed up in the so-called distributional hypothesis: linguistic items with similar distributions have similar meanings.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics) \n",

The word \"sesquipedalian\" is definitely new to me but I could guess it means something like a formal, hard-to-follow, academic language after reading the word in context: \"\"Although he was a brilliant scholar, his lectures were often difficult to follow due to his tendency towards sesquipedalian language.\""

    "What is a reasonable alternative to dense word representations? **One-hot-encoding** (OHE) might first come to your mind which was the way to go in traditional NLP. When using OHE, you basically treat words as discrete, atomic symbols. This way of representing words is usually refered to as **sparse**, in contrast to dense, distributed  **representation** (like Word2Vec).\n",

Let's say I want to represent the words: \"Chinese crested dog\", \"Dachshund\", \"Bolognese\", \"Labrador\" and  \"Newfoondland\".

The individual words have their own dedicated dimension and if you were to calculate similarity between of these words vectors e.g. dot product, you end up with 0."

For the dense representation, distributed, representation only 2 dimensions are used in contrast to the 5 dimensions using sparse, OHE representation. In my opinion, this toy example illustrates how dense vectors capture meaning. Using the very simple distance metric, the taxicab distance (also known as L1 and Manhattan distance), we can clearly see that a dachshund is more similar to bolognese (d=0.88) than to a Newfoondland (d=4.78) because the distance between the two is smaller. Using sparse representation, you would be not able to calculate different degrees of similarity. All sparse vectors would have 0 similarity because the vectors are orthogonal to each other. "

    "In summary, Word2Vec beat all previous benchmarks and managed to cut down the on training time vastly which allowed the authors to train on a larger corpus than it was possible before. They used the Google News, a Google proprietary, dataset which contains ca. 6B tokens and has a vocabulary size of 3M. For reference, the Oxford English Dictionary contains over 600,000 words and Phrases [4]. What comes to my surprise is that only a few epochs are needed to train the model. In the paper they used 1-3 epochs. Probably this is enough because the 6B token long dataset containts ca. 6B samples which is quite a number. _FUN FACT: Word2Vec was originally implemented on CPUs. It was 2013 and GPUs were already on their way revolutionizing AI but still a year after the seminal paper of Krizhevsky et. al. I guess there were strong reasons why they did all this on CPUs._ At this point, I think it is important to note that Word2Vec was first introduced in [1] and then further developed in [2].\n",

It is important to highlight that Word2Vec is an **NN-based** algorithm because around the time of its publication there were other, non-NN-based algorithms like count-based methods e.g. co-occurence matrix factorization methods and GloVe [9]. It is a **pre-training** algorithm because its resulting word embeddings is mostly used for downstream NLP tasks where these embeddings are either frozen or jointly optimzied in the downstream task. It is also **unsupervised** which means that no human supervision like labels are being used during training. The supervision comes from the data itself i.e. how words follow each other. \n",

The choice of this parameter was not explained in the paper and one might actually want to tune it. \n",

N is usually 50-300 and V in the Google News Dataset, as mentioned before, 3M. The input weight matrix is tasked with generating the input embedding for the task, while the output matrix will produce the predictions i.e. probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. This will make more sense in a bit. For now what is crucial to understand, is that each token has an embedding in the input word matrix, this will be its context embedding and an embedding in the output word matrix which is its center embedding in. In other words, each word has 2 embeddings. The tokens in the Vocabulary need to be mapped to indices, so we can look up their embeddings in the input or output matrices using indexing. _FUN FACT: Zyzzyva is an actual word and refers to a type of weevils.

To get the average context, we take the row-wise average of the context word embeddings. Using the output (center) matrix, we calculate the dot product between each word in the vocabulary and the averaged context embedding. This is a matrix-vector multiplication. In the resulting score vector each item refers to the similarity (dot product) between the avereage context and the words in the vocabulary. To get a probability distribution over the vocabulary, we apply softmax normalization. The y_true vector will be OHE where the single non-zero element is at the index of the center word.

Here, I am making use of [2] and [3] but I make an effort at simplyfying the notation and provide a more detailed explanation.\n",

In section \"Illustrated Forward and Backward Pass\", we said that each word has a corresponding context (input) and center (output) word vector. Let's denote  the context word matrix as $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times |V|}$ where $k_{i}$ refers to the i-th column of K meaning the context embedding of word at index i. The center word matrix is denoted by $ U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V| \\times n}$ where center word embeddings are stacked row-wise.

Below $u_{t}$ refers to the context embedding of the context word at position t. $\\bar{k_{c}}$ refers to the average context embedding of the context words. By taking the dot product between these two, we get a similarity metric (an unnormalized one) between the center word and the average context. The higher the dot-product the more similar the vectors are i.e. the vectors point to a similar direction. By calculating the dot product between all center word embedding and the average context embedding in the vocabulary (the denominator) and applying softmax, we get a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary.\n",

If you have a noun center word followed by a verb context, then the upcoming context is quite unlikely to be a verb again. To give you an example, if you have the word `Chelsea` (a famous football club and also a district in London) as the center followed be `played` context then the next context is less likely to be a verb like `jump` and more likely to be an adjective like `marvelously `. Seeing this example you may even give semantical arguments why the conditional independence does not hold like nouns more related to football e.g. `game` is more likely to come up than academics related nouns e.g. `conference.` Nonetheless, Skip-Gram manages to work well in practice, thus we may be okay with this.

    "It seems that we have a loss function so we are all set! Almost... We still need to figure out **how to draw negative samples** i.e. define $P(\\tilde{w_{j_i}})$. One might think of using a uniform distribution but that does not take into account word frequencies that we may want to take into consideration. The authors recommend using a scaled version of the unigram distribution $U(w)$ (model based on word frequencies). They found empirically that the unigram distribution raised to the power of 3/4 $U(w)^{3/4}$ works best. To build some intuition why this may be a particularly useful setting, let's look at the below table of example. We have a 3 words, one is very frequent (at), another less frequent (cinema) and an infrequent one (dachshund). If we raise their relative frequencies to 3/4, then relatively, the infrequent dachshund gets 3x more frequent, cinema 1.7 while at only 1.5. You can see that by using this scaled version of unigram distribution for negative sampling, we increase the probability of drawing less frequent words on the expense of more frequent ones. This intuitively makes sense because without this, we may be drawing too similar negative samples e.g. \"the, it\" which does not seem to be noise, against we want to contrast the word embeddings."

    "### Subsampling of frequent words\n",
    "\n",
    "Another trick that Word2Vec applies to put less emphasis on frequent words is subsampling. The authors argue that words like “in”, “the”, and “a” occur hundreds of millions of times in a large corpus of text. The co-occurence of these words arguably does not provide any useful information with other words e.g. \"Paris\". However, the co-occurrence of other words e.g. \"Paris\" and \"France\" has immense useful information. Thus, it seems plausible to subsample the frequent words which speeds up training by skipping a share of the frequent word samples. Below, $P(x)$ denotes the probability of x being skippend, $f(x)$  the frequency of the word, $t$ is a chosen threshold recommended to be around $10^{-5}$. It is obvious that infrequent words will have very high probability of being picked. Frequent words are more likely to be skipped but this may be offset by a higher choice of $t$ hyperparameter."

    "\n",
    "Though this has been quite an in-depth Word2Vec explainer, there is still a lot more to explore within and beyond the scope of Word2vec. I am going to just share a few more things in an unstructured way. You may decide to explore any of these in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameters\n",
    "Throughout the post, I tried to point out the recommended range of hyperparameters. [8] provides further comments and tips by the authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended HPs:\n",
    "- Embedding size: 50-300\n",
    "- Context size: 5-10\n",
    "- Algorithm: Skip-gram/ CBOW\n",
    "- #negative samples: 2-5 (if dataset big enough) if using Negative Sampling and not Hierarchical Softmax\n",
    "- Epochs: 1-3\n",
    "- Subsampling threshold $t$: ca. $10^{-5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper does not touch upon what optimizer to use but one might benefit from using an adaptive one like Adam. This might make sense because we may want to apply larger updates to less frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "The quality of the dataset is maybe more important than the specific HP settings we choose. The paper used the proprietary Google News dataset but there are now much bigger datasets! Just look at how GloVe [8] benefits from larger and better datasets.\n",

    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluating word vectors is an interesting task. There are 2 ways to do this: 1) intrinsic and 2) extrinsic. In intrinsic evaluation, typically, we do some kind of arithmetic of word embeddings and contrast it to our expectations. There are word similarity and analogy datasets that have been curated by humans. The authors open-sourced their own datasets for intrinsic evaluation: [link](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/word2vec/blob/master/questions-words.txt). It contains semantic and syntactic analogies like \"Athens-Greece+Madrid=Spain\" and \"occasional-occasionally+amazing=amazingly\" In extrinsic evaluation, we see how the word embeddings influence the performance of downstream applications where these are used as inputs. Note, that the latter is less sterile because we not only expect \"good\" word embeddings but also a good interaction between them and the downstream-specific application algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias\n",
    "Since Word2Vec is trained on large corpus of data, it will be exposed of all the biases that surround us. Just think about how more often it will see male references to politicians or engineers and much less for kingergarten teacher or nurse. This begs loads of ethical questions and for solutions. This is a very important topic and I might devote more time to explore it more in a follow-up post. For now, you can take a look at [10] for more details or the \"Bias and overgeneralization\" part of [11].\n",
