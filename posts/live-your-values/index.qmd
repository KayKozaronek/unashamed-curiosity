# Live Your Values

This is a post about an exercise I found valuable. It seems to me like knowing who you are is imperative to everything that you'll ever do. 
Most recently, I've been doubting the career path I have been wandering on. Feelings of self doubt and anxiety were determining my dat to day. I tracked my mood and was horrified to find that in the past month my mood has dropped significantly (downward shift) and that the variance in mood levels has increased significantly. This felt certainly far from healty and indicated that something was wrong. 

I began seeking advice in the form of talking to friends, consulting with coaches and reading books. A clear message crystalized: I needed to know who I am in order to better interpret how my observations shape my feelings, what the associated needs are that are met or violated and what requests I ought to make to myself or others to live a live that's more in line with my needs.

Needs of course are an expression of what we value, and hence I performed and exercise that came in a neat little box titled "The live your values deck" - by Lisa congdon and Andreea Niculescu.
The deck is comprised of 78 cards. 
- 73 have a value with a short definition on one side and ideas for how to implement it on the other side
- 2 blank cards to fill in values that you think are missing from the deck 
- 3 cards help you sort your values from 
  - Matters most to me 
  - Matters some to me 
  - Doesn't matter to me 


I agree with Dabrowski that personality is shaped by creating a set of a hierarchy of values: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration 

However, I doing this exercise I feel less like this is a set structure that will necessarily persist for eternity. I see it more like a screenshot in time that I will be able to go back to and compare to my values at a given other time (i.e. every year)


## Why am I writing this? 
- I am wirting this because I think 

## How does the exercise work?
Here's how it works: 
1. Create 3 Piles (Matters most to me, Matters some to me, Doesn't matter to me).
2. Go through the cards and put each of them them in either of the 3 piles ("Don't read on before finishing this step")
3. Now take only the "Matters most to me" pile and filter it for the top 10 values 
4. Rank your top 10 in order 
5. Use your values to design life that is more aligned


## Who am I?

### Doesn't Matter to me 
- activism 
- civic engagement 
- spirituality *  
- romance * 
- parenting 
- generosity * 
- service *
- environment
- moderation 
- family
  

I noticed that a lot of these values that are focused on others don't tend to play a large role in my life right now. I am happy to engage with others to the extent that we can mutually make our lives more awesome, but that's about it. I'm selective when it comes to who I want to spend my time with and my peer group is usually designed more than not.  

### Matters some to me 
- justice 
  - I think I value equality and fairness, but justice sounds rather foreign to me (very legal speaky) 
- humility
  - I struggle with this 
- work ethic
- inclusiveness
- mindfulness
- stability 
- beauty
- health
- compassion
- civility
- kindness
- loyalty
- collaboration
- empathy
- solitude
- patience *
  - This is aspirational, I'm not very patient
- intuition * 
- harmony 
- equality
- wisdom * 
- diversity

### Matters most to me 
- self-awareness
- social-connection
- passion
- love
- optimism
- respect
- gratitude
- genuineness
- courage
- resilience *
- contribution
- self-expression
- knowledge
- creativity
- career
- integrity
- success
- self-respect
- purpose
- thrift
  - For most of my life I've lived a very thrifty lifestyle and I intend on continuing like this. It is in service of my highest value: independence. Financial freedom is what gives me power to decide what I want to do, where I want to be and who I want to spend my time with 
- openness
  - I love learning things and openness keeps me open for new experiences. 
- vulnerability
  - I think it's very important to communicate your feelings and needs appropriately so that you can quickly implement changes that will enhance your social interactions. Without allowing yourself  to be vulnerable or tolerate someone elses vulnerability it's hard to start this process.
- humor
  - Not taking myself or others too seriously is a superpower that allows me to stay calm and collected even in adversarial situations. When my life is not going in the right direction my humor usually suffers first. My level of humor is a good indicator of my well being.
- assertiveness
  - I strive to communicate my needs and desires in an appropriate manner and be resolute in the requests I make.
- forgiveness
  - I don't hold grudges. Most problems can be traced to miscommunication and a simple clarifying conversation can be healing
- leadership*
  - I aspire to be a better leader and msot of what I've done until now is in service of this. I might have forgotten it along the way and have certainly not practiced it enough in the past few months, but I want to get back.
- rationality
  - It's very important to me to make decisions that are well informed
- adventure
  - I value novel experiences and I like to explore 
- non-conformity
  - I like to think for myself and I absolutely hate dogmatism
- simplicity
  - Simplicity means reduction of clutter. Less clutter = more focus = better quality = more wellbeing 

### Top 10-ish Values 
1. independence
    - I think it's more about autonomy than independence 
2. excellence
3. growth
4. ambition
5. fun
6. curiosity
7. risk-taking
8. education
9.  order
10. self-discipline
11. responsibility
