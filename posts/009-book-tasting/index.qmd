You probably read books like you eat dinner. One plate at a time. What if you could sample different books, savoring a variety of ideas just like you would at a buffet? I'm inviting you to try a book buffet.

Our ordinary way of consuming books is linear: start at the beginning and read to the end. Progress is often measured in **pages read** or **books completed**. But what if there was a more enjoyable way?

Imagine being given 10 plates of your 5 favorite dishes but being forced to eat one dish at a time until all 10 plates are gone before moving on to the next dish. While some might enjoy devouring 10 pizzas, most of us would quickly grow tired of it. This approach would make even our favorite foods turn into a soul crushing event with the potential for inducing serious PTSD.

Instead, consider a book buffet. Just as you wouldn’t eat the same dish for every meal for weeks on end, try varying your reading. Sample different books during the week, within the same day or heck, even during the same sitting. 

Here's how you can start your own book buffet:

1. Gather several books - Choose a diverse selection that piques your interest.
2. Read the synopsis - Grab the first book and read the cover to get a feel for the theme.
3. Skim the table of contents - Look for sections that catch your eye.
4. Start reading - Dive into the interesting section you identified.
5. Interrupt - Stop reading whenever you want to 
   1. Reflect 
   2. Take a break 
   3. Return to step 3
6. Switch books when saturated - If you want to try a different taste, put the book aside and pick up another.
7. Repeat - Start from Step 2 with a different book."


**Quick tips:** 
To make the most of your book buffet, start with a small selection - three to six books is ideal. This allows you to give each book enough attention without feeling overwhelmed. Don’t feel guilty if one book captivates you more than the others. Allow yourself to drown in a single book if it really speaks to you and be ruthless with books that don't excite you; it's all part of the experience. Remember to timebox your reading sessions to avoid "book trance" unless that's your goal.

Next time you settle in for a reading session, consider turning it into a book buffet. Bon appétit!
