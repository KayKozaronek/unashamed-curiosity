Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the tyranny of the blank page? Are you wishing to incorporate writing into your life but have failed to do so consistently? 

Recently, I started stacking another habit on top of my morning reading routine. Now, after reading, I take some time to reflect and write. My writing is guided by a few simple rules that help me stay focused. Here are the rules that help me produce 1 mini-essay per day: 

1. Stick to 1 idea and 1 idea only 
2. Keep it short:
    1. Time limit: 10-20 minutes 
    2. Word limit: 100-500 words
    3. Page limit: The essay should be visible on **one page** without the need to scroll
3. Keep the essays organized 
    1. Use a **Kanban board** to track the process through all stages from raw idea to published 
    2. Include **Tags and Folders** for easy retrieval
    3. **Link** **to other ideas** that are relevant (Maybe your own past posts)
    4. **References** (Where did you get this idea? What prompted it? Books, videos, articles)
4. The three part structure:
    1. **Intro** 
        1. Try any of the following: Introduce curiosity with a **Hook** / Be clear about the **Premise /** Use a **bold statement** / ask a provoking **question** / evoke strong **emotions /** throw the reader straight into the action by means of a **story**
    2. **Body** 
        1. Answer the premise of the intro
        2. Optional: Try a **Story Note** (use story telling to bring a point across)
            1. Choose the **point** you're trying to make 
            2. Amplify the message by choosing an **illustrative story** 
            3. For hard topics depersonalize the story by using **non human characters** or **humor** 
    3. **Conclusion** 
        1. Keep it short and simple (KISS) - 1 or 2 sentences
5. Feedback (3 sanity checks)
    1. **Read the essay out loud** to assess how it flows. This is an unreasonably powerful tool to quickly notice and change odd sentences 
    2. **Ask an AI to rate the essay** & provide feedback on how to improve it 
        1. Here's my custom GPT - [Mini Essay Critic](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-i8N8o0fnk-mini-essay-critic)
    3. **Ask another person for feedback** and written comments 
    4. Optional: Wait a few days to let the idea simmer before returning to it with fresh eyes and doing a few last changes.
6. Optional: Include an illustration 
    1. **Make a custom graphic** for more important posts (with Excalidraw, Figma or Miro) or 
    2. Use an existing graphic if 
        1. Preserving precision of information is important (e.g. data plots) or 
        2. Creating a custom graphic would be prohibitively time intensive 

Following these simple rules can transform your writing routine into a structured and productive daily habit.
