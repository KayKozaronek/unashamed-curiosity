Imagine you're navigating a dense forest, seeking a path to safety. You need a map (diagnosis), a clear route to follow (implementation policy), and a guide to lead you step by step (action plan). At its core, a strategy is just like that â€“ a triad of essential elements that guide you through any complex situation.

A couple comes to Eric's office. As a therapist it's his job to sit them down and talk. They express their frustration with the current situation: too little sex, bad financial decisions, distrust, constant bickering, and pesky in-laws. Through the cloud of annoyance, frustration, anger, grief, and resentfulness, Eric identifies a common pattern: the husband spends more time with his friends than his wife because they don't have common interests in past-time activities. Eric probes the couple with questions to arrive at this **problem diagnosis**.

The obvious next question is: "What can the couple do to fix this issue?" Here are a number of examples of **implementation policies**:

1. Try one new hobby each week until they find something both of them like, then double down. (**Explore & Exploit**)
2. Integrate the wife into at least one activity per week that the husband does with his friends. (**Social Integration**)
3. Make the wife commit to doing one activity the husband likes for at least one month, once a week, in the hope that she'll acquire useful skills that make her enjoy the activities more. (**Passion through Skill Building**)

The couple likes option 3. A good plan, however, is useless without putting it into action. So they administer an **action plan**:

1. Agree on an activity (e.g., play snooker together).
2. Set a recurring meeting that works with both schedules (e.g., Monday 19:00-21:00).
3. Show up and receive rewards (e.g., have their favorite meal after the snooker game).

There we go. At its bare minimum, a strategy is this: a diagnosis, an implementation policy, and an action plan.
